Joe Rogan has over $1million line up for charity if someone will debate RFK Jr. on vaccines. So far nothing but refusals and gas lighting, with Peter Hotez (the one they really want to debate against) saying that the military should get involved to stop this.###[Meta] Sticky Comment

It's fauci's replacement.It’s started with Rogan’s $100K, and all I found was it jumped to 600K (Steve Kirsch) & 800K (Tim Pool, which is funny because he’s become a “beat around the bush” guy). Who all has put into this?Can someone explain his thoughts and research on the covid vaccines? 
All I find here are twitter screenshots and everything else on the internet is very vague. 

So he’s not anti-vax. But is concerned about the vaccine safety of covid vaccines. 
Is this everything?Sounds like they are unwilling to "save gramma" with that $1 mil.I’m from the Military. Now, what am I supposed to be stopping?  Oh, someone’s free speech?  I think not mf!The military should stop this valid exercise of free speech. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Clown worldThis guy came on Rogan & specifically told everyone he doesn’t take ANY vitamins, doesn’t even work out… yet is a “health” expert.SS

Pfizer’s Clinical Trial Had More Deaths After Vaccination than Placebo https://forum.demed.com/COVID/posts/elZaI13OjbJA5h441xNy

He is calling on the military to stop debate

Wow.It’s so weird being gaslit by so many people about this. I don’t get it. I don’t care if someone believes rocks can telepathically communicate with humans… if someone offers money to needy people for me to debate them and prove how ridiculous and “delusional” they are… I would in a heart beat. What is going on here?Peter Hotez is a joke. Take off that bow tie and step into the ring lil guy. You’re looking like a bitch. Nut up or back out.I like how they still try to use "conspiracy theorist" as a derogatory label.Let’s not forget that after Joe Rogan caught & got over covid, CNN reposted the video Rogan posted, & put a yellow filter on his skin, don’t believe look it up, these people are not your friend.I would pay to watch the live stream debate. You know, for science...I'd sell my soul to get to the bottom of this bullshit. As nice as it sounds, whether it's 100k or a mill that's chump change for Joe :/All the critics on Twitter just mock them but have their replies turned off to protect their feelings. If they were so confident, they could go on Joe's program and bank money for their favorite charityGet the milit.....what? Do they even know what fascism is or is a word they know if they use it they get ice cream to shut them up. They seriously have no idea how hot fire is but they want to play with it anyway.

Let both sides talk. Let's hear the data points on both sides. Ill be the one to decide who made the better point.*I think* the shills who are taking additional bribes from pharma-lobbyists aren't actually allowed to directly engage with ***misinformation***. They get paid to say "no, you're wrong" but they aren't actually allowed to RESPOND to the specific things and quote whatever you're supposedly wrong about...Obviously the reason Hotez is terrified of a debate is because he knows RFK is right about at least some of what he’s said. These would be things damaging to ”the science“ and pharma. So even if he thinks he’s wrong about a lot, he just can’t put himself in a position to have to make any admissions at all.They know they're done. The cat is out of the bag.You can’t really debate with people when you don’t have a shared understanding of reality.People still love living under this rogue regime that answers to no one in the public? Why keep funding a rogue federal cabal?Bertrand Russell was born into one of the most prominent aristocratic families in the UK. They were also eugenics enthusiasts.

Russell “surmises” in 1952:

>**“Diet, injections, and injunctions will combine, from a very early age**, to **produce** the sort of character and the sort of **beliefs that the authorities consider desirable,** and any serious criticism of the powers that be will become psychologically impossible.”

>”The system, one may surmise, will be something like this: except possibly in the governing aristocracy, **all but 5 per cent of males and 30 per cent of females will be sterilized.** The 30 per cent of females will be expected to spend the years from eighteen to forty in reproduction, in order **to secure adequate cannon fodder.”**

>**”Gradually, by selective breeding, the congenital differences between rulers and ruled will increase until they become almost different species.** A revolt of the plebs would become as unthinkable as an organized insurrection of sheep against the practice of eating mutton. (The Aztecs kept a domesticated alien tribe for purposes of cannibalism. Their regime was totalitarian.)”

>The Impact of Science on Society,
Bertrand Russell, 1952Peter might need the military for how bad he’ll get slaughtered in a debate.Those guys dont do debates because they are cowards. i would love to see Biden debate anyone, like a normal person. Also am still waiting on anyone to debate Hancock.I love when Joe gets triggered and feels passionate.I listened to the podcast and have to admit when he said his Aunt struggled with mental issues I did start questioning him put a bad taste in my mouth to anything else he said (his Grandfather had his Aunt Lobotomized due to her being a bit of a wild child of the time and he decided lobotomizing her and having her institutionalized until the end of her life was a better option). but it does raise some serious questions he could write that book and say all this shit about Faucci and not be hit with a slander or liable lawsuit.This is the type of behavior I had hoped to see from Rogan when I first heard he made so much f you money from the spotify deal. Hope he continues this is greatPeople like Tom Nichols  and the professor there are just shitty shills. If I ran the country I'd literally start locking people like him up. I don't even care anymore. They all need to go to prison. They are the reason this country sucks.

The fact this fuckhead is literally trying to say unvaccinated were dying in waves, when in reality all those numbers were fabricated and now we have a daily died suddenly contest with celebrities says it all.

We are in a fucking weird simulation, because actual humans I refuse to believe behave this ridiculously stupid.

These people are SO afraid to have a public debate, just like Fauci ducked Mullis all those years.For a million, I would debate him about Santa Claus.Holtz hasn't produced a valid argument backed by straight facts since this shitshow began. His twitter is nothing but ad hominems and trash talk. So, just like everone else on team jab when you pay attention. He's a dsgusting, arrogant, soulless sellout. 

Not a chance him or anyone else will debate risk/benefit in a very public arena. They have nothing to debate with. The product they push is deadly junk."Never debate" -The Reasonable Side™Joe is back at the whole looking at comments thing againWhere does he say the military should intervene?I just read this article today lmfaooo oh my days this blows this whole con completely out of the water. The fact some are asking the MILITARY to get involved just shows how badly the goverments and their lapdog think of us.

WHY give THIS SO MUCH ATTENTION if it ISN'T true?? WHY CALL THE MILITARY?? Who are you scared of and who do you think your trying to scare with threats of military!!! This alone is so gross.Rfk is just another grifter using red herring talking points while simultaneously push for deregulation of big pharma.Bunch of lead paint chip eating maroons up in here lol.I watched a presentation on Rumble called Covenom-19 by Stew Peters. What I saw in that video was beyond upsetting. Several doctors have examined the contents of these vials of supposed vaccine. What they discovered if true, is beyond insane. They found living cells that are not supposed to be there of course. But that's not the real problem. These cells appear to be replicating and producing peptides at room temperature. But not just any peptides, they appear to be identical to venom peptides.

 I wish I was making this up, but it is not a joke. I don't have the time to play around when people's lives are at stake. I suggest everyone alive to go watch that presentation immediately. Because if what those doctors found is true and I believe it is, the people that have taken these injections are being slowly invenomated. That would explain the blood clots, myocarditis, pericarditis, neurological damage, nerve damage, and of course death that people are experiencing. Those are all the signs and symptoms of invenomation.Somebody needs to get [Hbomberguy](https://youtu.be/8BIcAZxFfrc)In no way could anyone opposed to this vaccine misinformation win a debate vs these people. Believing in the conspiracy has all the outcomes rationalized through the conspiracy. They will not accept any amount of evidence.Military will go running once they see Joe Rogan kickboxing with his shirt off

Jokes aside. We’re fuckedNow do 9/11, Joe, you coward gate keeper.So it’s been more than two years, can anyone tell me when all the vaccinated people are going to suddenly drop dead?

I was promised they would all be dead by nowRFKJR thinks WiFi causes cancer lmao. You don't debate conspiracy theorists and crackpots, there is no point, even if they're offering money, it's not worth it.1. I don't believe he has the money or would pay it out if he lost because he'd never admit he would
2. Most medical professionals refuse to give any sort of legitimacy to crackpots.The guy rogan is replying to is absolutely right. You don't wrestle a pig. You'll both end up covered in shit but the pig wants it. Rfk is the pig.Don’t really know who this Peter guy is, but if he believes he’s “correct”, and believes the other guy is “incorrect”….there is literally no reason to decline a debate.There won’t ever be a debate and the military will probably get involved at some point as more and more people reject the “science” of the WHO, NIH, MSM and the US Government."Never debate a conspiracy theorist"

Never legitimize a conspiracy theorist, either.I'll debate him. I'm great at talking in circlesRogans Terms & Conditions are funny: “willing to debate him on my show with no time limit”.
No time limit? What?Joe Rogan is controlled opposition. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYctRWeKCAA  

Just like Alex Jones, Eddie Bravo and David Icke.I used to watch Joe for entertainment. Joe himself had said several times in the past that he's stupid. Joe is an entertainer. What qualification does Joe or Elon have to "debate" this man. I'll help. NONE.

&#x200B;

Edit:You can’t fucking have a real and fact based debate with someone who thinks that wifi signals cause autism and brain cancer. Full stop.The military is already involved at the other end of the spectrum and that's a no shit why is this even here.Rfk spouts so much  nonsense and has such a disregard for facts that there is no point in debating himProbably cause it's for charity and they (Hotez & friends) have no interest in that.

Unless it's one of their tax havens that they funnel money into.Peter Hotez developed a vaccine which he then gave away for free.

RFK is a grifter and a fraud.Is this on all vaccines, or just the COVID vaccine? I don’t really care for RFK Jr.’s across the board anti-vax views.


Really, there’s almost no logical defense anybody can give of the COVID vaccine at this point. There are several studies showing the vaccines to have negative effectiveness against COVID infection, and the CDC of all sources finds the vaccines to even have negative effectiveness against COVID hospitalization.  The COVID vaccines also  seem to have a poor  record of side effects, even though the picture about the COVID vaccine’s side effects  is somewhat less clear than the vaccine’s lack of effectiveness. 

The only people who think the vaccines work are the people who have really brainwashed themselves into thinking they did something useful by getting the vaccine, and I doubt a debate between RFK Jr. and Hotez would change their mind. (And unfortunately Reddit seems to indicate that the people who have totally brainwashed themselves about the vaccine might comprise about 70% of the population. At least if you assume that Redditors are even telling the truth about still believing in the effectiveness of the vaccines.)What was said about the military?I’ll do it. I mean who doesn’t want the money to go to charity.It’s pretty fitting that Hotez is the co-director of Parasites Without Borders. It’s a pretty apt title for him and his ilkI’ll debate him. I won’t win but I’ll debate him and claim the money.I’d pay $200 ppv to see fauci debate himif I hear the word gaslighting again, I might become a reddit mod.Everything is gaslighting.Is RFK capable of talking in a nuanced way about all the actual research done on the vaccines?Lol I’d love for him to debate Fauci, but they’d have to hire voice actors to reread the transcript before I’d listen to itI think the reason for not debating is because they don’t want to legitimize conspiracy. I tend to agree with this, as no one should give people who believe flat earth, or any of the more crazy conspiracies that have absolutely no factual backing, the time of day. This vaccine conspiracy though, should be debated, and I hope Dr. Hotez reconsiders. A large swathe of the American public are questioning vaccines at the moment, and if it’s something that is very easy to counter and explain, I would hope Dr. Hotez would do so. If he’s incapable of doing so, we should know why he can’t. Of course, regardless of the outcome of the debate, a lot of people will not be swayed either way, and will stick to their beliefs, so I also get not wanting to debate because of that.I had two friends who got Covid bad. Hospitalized. One had one shot. He survived.You guys obsess over the dumbest shit, I hardly ever about any talk about Covid or the vaccineslol Joe Rogan is such a piece of shit.  If you're ever wondering if he should have any place in this debate, listen to him try to work out simulation theory.  Wowsa.False. I'll debate em right now.  So clearly it's not "someone" they want someone specific and that someone specific probably has better things to do then destroy a monkey and his friends in a debateHey!! Did you know RFK JR is listed on the Epstein Lolita express flight logs? Why didn’t rogan rip him to shreds when he was on his show? Controlled oppositionhttps://twitter.com/thebadstats/status/1669867793465081858?t=RMn3IlJO5S8MDSbsrrq2rg&s=19

Breaking down RFK Jr's lies.I'd quite happily debate RFK about JFK - oh, and RFK's Nazi appeasing, cheese eating surrender monkey of a grandfather too.Bro what is happening here? 😂 but for real I missed somethingI’m concerned that Joe has decided to get suicided all of a suddenIsn't Fauci's replacement some woman?no need for debate, we already knowWas gonna say.

[@RealMSWTruth](https://twitter.com/RealMSWTruth)Edit: SORRY thought you meant Dr Hotez

I can't explain very much of it, but I've seen a lot of clips of him towing the party line including things like: there's no such thing as herd immunity, ~~one~~ ~~two~~ ~~three~~ ~~four~~ five shots are all you need and it's long-lasting protection, we may need another booster every few months, kids need the covid max as much as adults... 

But with no admission of ever having been wrong about any of thisThe point of his book anyway, was that big pharma pours money into research facilities, and government agencies, to make sure things go their way. He documents how studies are faked, and steps are skipped, to insure a "successful" outcome (for them).Yes basically. We need more testing a science over just fundingYou have the one word answer. Which is a soundbyte with no context, to really understand the issue. And a bigger problem that those responsible for protecting the public allow this to happen since 1989, and without any liability, big pharma is now injecting kids with some 80 shots, many at the same time, each with side effects. And injecting newborns at birth - so parents never get to see behavior changes in the child that were obvious in 2005.

 This is 2005 shortish interview with Jon Stewart on the Daily Show.Listen to the Rogan podcast. He lets him go for 3 hours. He’s also concerned with mercury in ‘normal’ vaccines.If it was Ralph Nader saying it the Left would say he's caring about us.he’s not anti vax, just against people literally losing their jobs & livelihood for not wanting a vax, or simply having a different opinion. Funny how all things made by the FDA take alll these years to complete, yet covid’s vaccine was magically finished in a year, were also told & i fucking quote “The virus ends with you, get the shot, you can’t catch it, or give it to anyone, when you get the shot” weeks later, the “science changed”. Do you not find it odd Burger King, Mcdonald’s, Dunkin, every corporation was wanting to give people free food for a vax…? if there’s anything i learned… these people don’t give out free shit for any reason. too much fuckery.Additionally adjuvants such as mercury (though "ethylmercury" was said to be safe vs methylmercury, that was disproven in a study involving monkey's which found the mercury in the brain) cause problems, source with quotes: **https: // www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov/pmc/articles/PMC1280342**/ (remove quotes, I dont post links anymore since they just often get shadowbanned dont want to have to retype comment)

"***Recent publications have proposed a direct link between the use of thimerosal-containing vaccines and the significant rise in the number of children being diagnosed with autism, a serious and prevalent developmental disorder*** *(for review, see IOM 2001) ...* ***The IOM review did, however, note the possibility of such a relationship and recommended further studies be conducted****. A recently published second review (IOM 2004) appears to have abandoned the earlier recommendation as well as backed away from the American Academy of Pediatrics goal.* ***This approach is difficult to understand, given our current limited knowledge of the toxicokinetics and developmental neurotoxicity of thimerosal****, a compound that has been (and will continue to be) injected in millions of* ***newborns and infants****. The key findings of the present study are the differences in the disposition kinetics and demethylation rates of thimerosal and MeHg"*I don't have a TL:DR but I accidentally stumbled upon his podcast with Rogan last night. I only listened for 30 mins but, he explains his stance in about 20 mins or soListen to Joe’s podcast with him. It’s complicated[This document](https://www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/RFK-JR-Response-061623.pdf) is his recent response to a smear article that appeared in National Review. He goes point by point correcting the errors, and in the process he describes many of his stances on this issue and many significant references are included as well. It's worth reading and sharing, even my rather skeptical friend found it persuasive.Just listen to his rogan podcast episodeThat is INSANE. I couldn't believe what I was reading.Dunno why you’re getting downvoted. That’s exactly what he did. Called himself a fast food junkie or something like that.[This is actually true lmao](https://www.bobsblitz.com/2022/12/joe-rogan-destroys-junk-food-eating.html?m=1)Without being into fitness and physical health, you can still follow the moneyFor better or for worse, that sounds like the life of the majority of US residents.Way back in 2021 (I think) Hotez tried calling for a "hate crime" law against questioning or doubting scientists or basically "the science". 

He also originally, and correctly, basically said that we couldn't vax our way out of a pandemic, but then put on his gymnast tights and flip flopped in the opposite direction claiming that we could.

He later developed a covid "vaccine" for poor people in poor countries. I always wonder if the flip flop and the approval of his flavor of shot were connected.> Pfizer’s Clinical Trial Had More Deaths After Vaccination than Placebo 

It’s a difference of *1* death, which is obviously not remotely statistically or clinically significant. That’s like a RR 1.05, with a 95% CI of 0.50 to 2.20. The number of deaths in the arms is so low that the difference is just tantamount to statistical noise. Moderna trial had 16 deaths in each arm; J&J, 28 in vaccine group vs 55 in placebo group, which is RR 0.51 (95% CI 0.32-0.80). Vaccine trials aren’t designed or powered to detect mortality differences, for good reason.Calling on the military…? To do what?Can’t wrap my head on this. Placebo means they received nothing..?  A sugar pill, saline solution.   Why are they dying.Vaccine safety

In this interim analysis of surveillance data from 6.2 million persons who received 11.8 million doses of an mRNA vaccine…This analysis found no significant associations between vaccination with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and selected serious health outcomes


https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2034577

A total of 43,548 participants underwent randomization, of whom 43,448 received injections. Safety over a median of 2 months was similar to that of other viral vaccines.


https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2110475

In the vaccination analysis, the vaccinated and control groups each included a mean of 884,828 persons.  In this study in a nationwide mass vaccination setting, the BNT162b2 vaccine was not associated with an elevated risk of most of the adverse events examined. 


https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-021-02059-5

A total of 87 publications with safety data from clinical trials and post-authorization studies of 19 COVID-19 vaccines on 6 different platforms were included. Available evidence indicates that eligible COVID-19 vaccines have an acceptable short-term safety profile.


https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(22)00054-8/fulltext

Safety data from more than 298 million doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine administered in the first 6 months of the US vaccination programme show that most reported adverse events were mild and short in duration.


https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00290-x

It is clear that coronavirus vaccines are safe and effective.


https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmv.27940

In this review, we synthesized the safety data of seven published RCTs and found that COVID-19 vaccines have shown good safety in the child and adolescent populations. Based on the systematic analysis of the published safety data of the four COVID-19 vaccines, we concluded that the safety of current COVID-19 vaccines for children and adolescents is acceptable.

This paper shows a favourable safety profile for the BNT162b2 vaccine.


https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2022.972464/full

Overall cumulative rates for reported sAEFI following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in the US over 1 year were very low.


https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2209367

Two 25-μg doses of the mRNA-1273 vaccine were found to be safe in children 6 months to 5 years of age and elicited immune responses that were noninferior to those in young adults


https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2798504?utm_campaign=articlePDF&utm_medium=articlePDFlink&utm_source=articlePDF&utm_content=jamanetworkopen.2022.42240

These findings suggest COVID-19 vaccination is not associated with an increased risk of herpes zoster, which may help to address concerns about the safety profile of COVID-19 vaccines


https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(22)00407-6/fulltext

The retrospective cohort included 94 169 participants who received the first booster and 17 814 who received the second booster. Comparing the 42 days before and after vaccination, the second booster was not associated with any of the 25 adverse events investigated, including myocardial infarction


https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(22)00426-1/fulltext

COVID-19 mRNA vaccines have a good safety profile in pregnancy.

2 deaths for 1 life saved.It’s harder to win a debate that you think, even IF you are 100% correct. People can throw false claims, argue exact definitions and make arguments with poor logical basis a lot faster than you can debunk them.

It’s also easier to play to a crowd than explain the nuances of policy or scientific method.The pharmaceutical industry has zero desire to see a debate. They can game the statistics if they control the information. They’ve already bought the researchers and regulators.He’s not terrified. He’s smart.

There’s no winning a debate against RFK, even with all the facts on your side. The Gish gallop is way too strong.Your comment is the exact reason why. The only people interested in this debate are anti-vaxxers who have already made up their minds. Any evidence that the pro vax side brings up will easily be dismissed as propaganda and lies (look what happens in this sub whenever someone uses studies from the CDC or WHO). 

Science isn’t done through in person debates like this, these are always just for show. You are asking people who were trained to work in a lab to come onto a live show and argue with someone who was groomed to be a politician by a family of politicans. He’s trained to make good sound bites and and twist the narrative. 

All a debate like this would prove is who is a better public speaker, it does nothing to prove any of the science. Why doesn’t it ever happen the other way? Why doesnt RFK Jr do medical research and publish his findings? Why is he scared to enter the scientists court?……no. It’s because RFK is a clownThey don't understand that. I'm reminded of the several flat earthers who essentially proved a globe and made up bullshit why the world is still flat.This sounds like HG Wells "the time machine"“We love Robert F. Kennedy Jr., but he is part of a misinformation campaign that’s having heartbreaking—and deadly—consequences.”

-His entire family 

https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/05/08/robert-kennedy-jr-measles-vaccines-226798/Have you ever dealt or tried to manage a person that was non verbal and aggressive? Obviously not saying that lobotomy is good. I don’t really see what the difference is between that or drugging someone everyday all day. These people are literally just drugged out of their minds to manage behaviors.

Coming from a therapist who worked in in-patient care. I think it was more her compulsive public masturbation.If this were to actually happen, it would be THE most downloaded podcast in history.>If I ran the country I'd literally start locking people like him up. I don't even care anymore. They all need to go to prison.

THAAAAAT'S FASCISM!People post multiple scientific studies disproving anti-vax propaganda on this sub daily and you all immediately ignore it, saying that it is just 'funded by Big Pharma'. There is literally zero benefit in him doing this debate because no matter what he says or what evidence he brings, all you anti-vaxxers have already decided that he is wrong.Look at tweets like this (with 0 traction, but alas google serves it up to me)

>Probably shouldn't feed this topic. But neither RFK Jr nor Joe Rogan are experts on anything related to medicine or vaccines. They haven't earned the right to "debate" Peter Hotez . Just as I haven't earned the right to "debate" Mike Tyson on boxing, though I've mouthed off a lot.

Uhhh, no. If Mike Tyson was offered millions of dollars (I think Mike is a charity guy too), and was physically able to stand in a ring with you, I'm sure he'd love to punch you into the mat, Mr. Professor Raywat Deonandan

Point is, even if you think you'd crush the guy or they'd be way under your class, ok then show them up and crush them into pieces for the world to see, and collect the money for the charity of your choice in the processi bet you LOOOOOVE paying 6K minimum for a hospital visit. I bet you looooooove having a person that’s 250lbs overweight & can’t breathe telling you how to get “healthy” lolhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj6-QDVYbv8Just letting you know stew Peter's is a stretch, even for meYeah I seen some of the arguments for that. It was that "watch the water" documentary.  It was compelling, and deserves to be looked at further (if all the info in the film was correct), but I think they didn't have the whole thing figured out. They filled in the blanks and that's where they lost me.  The part I struggled with was the delivery system (water). It just doesn't match the transmission pattern. Unless they were able to somehow combine those peptides with a virus.> What they discovered if true

And if it's not?Then just do it… hope some rational people watching can be convinced by you.. let charity have their money…and move on. What’s the problem?Well, I was promised a winter of severe illness and death a couple winters ago, yet here I still am. How about THAT?Likewise when are all the unvaccinated gonna die from covid … those numbers who died are all overestimated as they classed it a covid death even if it wasn’t, but just because they had a positive unreliable test they were all just a tick in a box!The money goes to charity. I think that’s worth it. Don’t you?Try looking at the counter arguments before being so sure. The newer research on bio-electricity is the latest new thing being lauded by traditional science.  And how DNA reacts to sound.They're not asking him to pay , they're paying him 100,000k to show up and debate.Just say you are scared to debate.  Lame ass analogies are not the answer if you can win a debate.  Hotez has don't nothing but cry for more censorship hahaExactly. If someone wanted to debate about whether people can speak to ghosts… and charity will get 100s of thousands. I would do it in a heartbeat knowing full well I could never convince them. Just be the bigger person and present the logic and facts and move on and let charities enjoy the donation. I don’t get it.Meaning each person will not be timed with their response. Like in a presidential debate, where they can't even finish their point half the time. 

I'm sure they don't mean no time limit,  like this is going to go on for weeks with no break and they'll have to eat meals while debating  and have a catheter to urinate.Yeah they can both get out everything they need to say and have time to site their sourcesSo what...

RFK Jr. Isn't. He has every right to be opposed to the system that murdered his Father & Uncle.Laughable that people miss this.Elon and Rogan aren't debating him. It's RFK Jr. vs. Peter. What qualification do you have to comment on the debate when you don't even have the reading comprehension to understand what is going on. I'll help. NONE.He has a massive platform for millions of people to hear what Hotez has to say. If Joe is stupid, Hotez should take the opportunity to dominate the debateJoe isn’t suggesting he be the one who debates.Joe Biden and Rachel Maddow both claimed on national TV that the vaccine stops the spread of covid 19. That's as out there as anything Joe has said. Does that mean the president and MSNBC aren't qualified to discuss vaccines?I think you're refused. He has the guests do the debating. He did the same thing when he had 2 dieticians debate about vegan/meat diets.

*confusedYou are mixing things up. I've never heard of anyone claiming those things. 

Cell phone radiation- brain cancer (specifically when held up to the head for long periods of time and often)

MMR vaccine- Autism (among other disorders and chronic health problems)You don't even understand the simplest of premises. You're not helping anyone, jack.The hell are you talking about fool.Sure there is! A good debate would openly demonstrate that he spouts nonsense and has disregard for facts. His opponents should therefore be fighting each other to debate him... *particularly* since he's apparently a Presidential contender.

But they're not. Seems like a clear dereliction of duty by the Pfaithful to me!they literally said the $$ will be donated to charity you 1 chromosome having dumb fuckSo there should be an honest debate and put this all behind us no? 
Then we know we can trust the pharmaceutical compa- I mean the science.Of that 70% only a fraction are immune to some questioning. Each person that begins to research, ask questions will influence many more. There is safety in numbers.  As I write it occurs to me that I have seen Zero people  so called anti-vaxxers shift convert to being pro-vax.   The only shifts come on the pro-vax side. What does this tell us?Cope harder

CheckmateI got one shot, been a symptomatic the entire time, ex smoker, slightly overweightbunch of ppl threw in pots over 1 mil nowPeople keep adding to the pool. Rogans initial offer was 100k, but with the additions from people who want to see it happen, the pool has reached 1million.It is still a thing.  Being forgetful or blissfully ignorant to the fact that this s*** didn't happen to the entire globeI agree man. Hey guys I was thinking a lot of mistakes were made over the past three years. That have long last effects, like changing the very nature of modern life. But I was thinking let it go. I now hardly ever think about being in perpetual lock down for the past three years. I mean, come on let us forget about all those cops beating people caught outdoors. They were beating because they love. Any way I too like my local sports team and you should stop thinking about things that don't matter, my dudes.There are a i versions of the logs now. Didn't see him on one from two yrs agoYou are a real redditor, thanks for that!How does Tate have so much fucking money?So as long as I throw down a grand or more my name could be added to this list?!Shit man I would put down $1000 myselfThere's a lot of money to be made saying whatever the elite want you to. If you just repeat their talking points verbatim without question money will just come to youZantac was considered safe for what 20 years before they found out it was a carcinogen? And roundup weed killer was considered such a safe weed spray until it wasn't! And then there's baby powder and cancer. They did a month testing on covid vaccines and ok their completely safe!Lol. What’s so special about him then? (Context: not from the us)that's quite a sentence you almost made there.This isn’t the interview just talk about the interview.No. They'd immediately reject him as crazy. Can't question any vaccine ever"People who advocate for safer vaccines should not be marginalized or denounced as anti-vaccine. I am pro-vaccine. I had all six of my children vaccinated. I believe that vaccines have saved the lives of hundreds of millions of humans over the past century and that broad vaccine coverage is critical to public health. But I want our vaccines to be as safe as possible."

Kennedy, Robert F. Jr., Thimerosal: Let the Science Speak (2015), p. 28.Where does it say the thing abt military intervention? Ive been keeping up on the drama, but haven't seen the Hotez request for military involvement.idk i guess people like taking health advice from people that can’t run 1 single lap around a track without almost dying.oh yeah, you find a lot of Faucci $$ ironically tied into Wuhan… Wuhan lab was a “racist” theory there for awhile but now even the FBI says it likely came from there. Also… what’s more racist, saying the virus came from a lab, or saying it came from people eating bats…. which is what they said😂>but then put on his gymnast tights

I could have done without that mental imageDon't confuse them with science....The routine removal of problem subjects is pretty typical of pharma research. 

Especially in double blind trials, can't find out if you were given a placebo without exiting the trial. If you have issues, you probably want to find out if you were given the placebo or not.> It’s a difference of 1 death, which is obviously not remotely statistically or clinically significant.

So then, the vaccine's effectiveness against death is statistically insignificant.

Got it.Because people occasionally die. Actually, everybody dies eventually...Big pharma learned a long time ago that when you add adjuvant to the placebo, you get very similar results between the two groups. 

It's common practice now. It's also documented and cited in *The Real Anthony Fauci*.Placebo in this case means the subjects received other things other than the MrNA vaccine, like adjuvants. So, it's not simply saline vs the covid vaccine.First 2 sentences of the article 

Clinical trials are supposed to be statistical comparisons. They are designed to compare the outcomes in the group receiving a novel product with the outcomes in the group receiving a placeboBecause even the placebos are rigged. They game the system by given them a known vaccine for the control group. Then compare those effects to the one they are testing.It takes so many studies to get conclusive proof; who knows?

It could be any number of things, bad luck for example, and against all odds it could be that any number of studies from one to infinite could lead to genuinely incorrect data(though in this case, it'd be unlikely.)

It could also be something as wild as the vaccine worked perfectly, and then somehow strengthened the virus's mutations against those who received a vaccine. I can't stress how impossibly unlikely this would be but, that doesn't render it impossible, just improbable.Because people die from things besides the placebo or the treatment, it's part of why you see wild side effects like strokes, blood clots, hemorrhage, etc for things like allergy medicine, if someone dies during trials then it has to be listed as a possible side effect even if it isn't caused by the medicine as a precaution.Bro, your copy pasta links say the Astra Zeneca vaccine was safe. That vaccine was literally pulled off the market because it was causing adverse reactions and severe injuries.

*edit: In April 2021, over 25 countries had restricted or suspended the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine because of safety concerns.

https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/some-countries-limit-astrazeneca-vaccine-use-eu-findings-jj-shot-expected-2021-04-20/All of this and yet it still kills people. It's too late now. Almost everyone knows someone who's been vaccine injured or worse. 

You've "jumped the shark", time to move on to the next scam. No one believes this crap.https://twitter.com/pbhushan1/status/1451807240659161090?s=20I am fully aware of that. The offer wasn’t to win a debate . It was too debate. As frustrating as it may be to debate someone and have them work the crowd by appealing to emotions and making false claims… it would be worth it to say the truth and hope some people are swayed to the light side AND help kids with charity money.This is the answer.
Big pharma has already won the propaganda/info battle.And the advertisers (news and big tech). The only thing they haven’t bought is podcasts which will ultimately be their downfall.No, he’s terrified. He should have kept his mouth shut. He got called out and his coward ass and all of his coward defenders don’t have any idea how to get out of it.> There’s no winning

Except for the over $1.5million to the charity of his choice... seems like a win to me.You think that’s a reasonable take, huh?Hotez is literally on MSNBC and CNN weekly of course he can speak for himselfObviously you have never been involved in any science. What do you think a person has to do in their dissertation?They literally just said RFK is right about at least some of what he’s saying. You think there’s absolutely no validity to that and everything he says is wrong, while big pharma companies who have lost countless lawsuits with payouts totaling in billions of dollars is telling the full truth? 

I just can’t wrap my head around why you think the idea of questioning an idea you’re confident in is bad. Either you’ll have your prior knowledge verified, or you’ll learn something new and be able to make better decisions. There’s no harm in being proven right and there’s only good that will come of learning where you may be wrong on something. 

Maybe you’ll be shown to be right and others will still find a way to take away the wrong message. Why’s that such a big deal? Those people are clearly doing so anyways, and they’re getting progressively more extreme because they’re getting pushed further and further towards the fringe to access information where there’s no pushback to a lot of genuinely insane ideas. Isn’t it a good thing to give those people are resource where they can find someone they believe in debating against someone who can actually give an accurate argument for accepted views?> The only people interested in this debate are anti-vaxxers who have already made up their minds.

Nope. That's just not a fair characterization of the situation. In the same way that it was valuable for Bill Nye to debate Ken Ham on creationism and evolution, this debate would be a valuable discussion to have, even if one or both sides are staunchly fixed in their minds and will not change positions.HG wells wrote far more nonfiction outliig his ideas for planned takeover of society.

RFK 2024You can’t stop taking a lobotomyNo dude. They just wanted to hide her away.Fact is this country needs some good old fascism of the proletariat kind. Time to upend the cycle. Of course you can't have that forever, but right now the scales are tipped to the point.While a couple of the studies implying that vaccines cause autism have been discredited, and there is some evidence against anti-vax hypotheses from other studies, the "gold standard" of randomized controlled experiments have not been performed. You can't really know the final answer until you run these studies.I think you missed the point of that Mike Tyson reference.No it’s horrible. The for profit healthcare philosophy in the United States is one of the most pressing issues we’re facing, and none of the major political players want to talk about it because voters are hung up on dumb bullshit like whether not trans people are allowed to exist or “they’re coming to take your guns!!!”Never shoot the messenger. He's just the curator of the presentation. There are credible scientists who are presenting their findings that have nothing to do with Stew. He's not even in the video. All I'm asking people to do is just watch it and keep an open mind. Because like I said, if those scientists are correct, these people are fucked. I do not have time to lie to people, all I can do is present information. I've only known the man to speak the truth honestly. They also offer several ways to counteract the effects of the injections thankfully. But for some people it's too late.Oh there's too much evidence that it's very true. They literally show the cells in real time under microscopy producing these venom peptides. All I can do is recommend people watch it and come to their own conclusions. I'm wishing that it wasn't true, but most likely it 100% is. These government agencies and laboratories have been cooking up some sinister stuff for a very long time. The main problem is the general populace doesn't believe that their government will kill them. They've done it before and they're doing it right now. When they're talking about "reducing your carbon footprint", YOU are the carbon that they want to reduce. You're made out of carbon and what better way to reduce that than for you to not exist anymore?You can laugh all you want. You know what's funny about the truth though? It doesn't care about your beliefs or your laughter. So just keep laughing. I can understand why people would be scared to watch the presentation, especially if they have taken these injections. I wouldn't want to watch it either. All I can do is present information. You have a nice life though.Just go to Rumble and type Covenom-19 into the search bar. Reddit doesn't allow links from Rumble.

Most would say no because all it does is legitimize his position as worth debating.  Same thought process here.Nothing like and actual real "debate" has and will ever happen on rogan. Rfk wants some good sound bites and if not he can (as you're saying) claim they're too scared. 

 It's like rogan having Jones of but he's going to have Jamie "live fact check" him. It takes 30 mins to check a single claim and Jones will spew a dozen lies in two minutes and steam roll on.In the metaphor, the pig is the one who actually wants to roll around in the mud and doesn't mind getting dirtier.I wondered if I was over simplifying things by adding that bit. Clearly I hadn't gone simple enough 🤦‍♂️.> go on for weeks with no break and they'll have to eat meals while debating and have a catheter to urinate.

You don't even have a grasp on English.Debating someone out out of your league doesn't help anyone eitherHe just openly spouted hours of nonsense that anyone can find is egregiously incorrect with a little research. 

We've all heard the  nonsense. Why would hearing it again help? Why waste the time of a reasonable person? If people are willing to believe anything he says while ignoring the facts they will just continue to the do that after the debate.

Very intelligent people have responded to his outrageous claims on this podcast already. There is no need to do it in person. Welcome to 2023.

https://twitter.com/thebadstats/status/1669867793465081858?s=20No money will be handed out anywhere if the debate doesn't happen.If you weren’t convinced of the COVID vaccine’s ineffectiveness after the vaccines fell into negative effectiveness during Omicron, there really is no way to convince you. Really, you were probably in a cult if you weren’t convinced of the COVID vaccine’s ineffectiveness by about September 2021 (around the time they abandoned the 95% effectiveness talk and claimed the vaccines were just meant to prevent hospitalizations, which is something claimed about no previous vaccine), but the beginning of Omicron is about the latest anybody might have been convinced. 

I do wonder how many people on Reddit actually believe in the effectiveness of the vaccine’s effectiveness and how many are just pretending to believe in the vaccine’s effectiveness. I mean, if you read the toddler subreddits you’d think the COVID vaccine uptake for toddlers is about 90%, but if you read actual news reports, the toddler COVID vaccine uptake was around 10%. Even if you adjust for Reddit’s political leanings, the odds that Reddit would differ so much from the rest of the world in getting their toddler vaccinated would be so infinitesemal that it would be hard to even write out in scientific notation. I’m not 100% sure that  Excel (or any program on a normal person’s computer) would even be capable of calculating such low odds. 

 There’s got to be a bunch of people on Reddit who are lying about believing the vaccines work, getting a zillion boosters and getting their toddler the vaccine.My friend got Covid in the very early days. There was no vaccine back then but he had high blood pressure. He got hospitalized for Covid and died of a heart attack.

It sucks being the victim of thr alpha strain. Thank God viruses tend to get weaker as they evolve and us later folks came out fine.No, both the CDC and NIH are women.

#I’m willing to match the total pot!not to mention every medication has side effects, some can legit destroy your organs, the fact most people cannot even agree that the vax has side effects (including death) shows how deep the indoctrination goes.

Its dumb to assume any medication doesn't have side effects.Pregnant women used to smoke & drink too??
Everything used to be made with Asbestos until it wasn't? 🤔The difference is that the vaccine is not something you take daily,  weekly,  or even monthly.  You take a small dose and then within a week or two there is no remaining part of the vaccine in your body.  The only lasting part is the mRNA that your own body produces.So how much research would you need before you were convinced that the vaccines are safe?Round up, and baby powder aren't tested as medicine. That's a stupid comparison.SARS-Cov vaccines had been under development for 15 years. MRNA vaccine development is even older.Btw, Roundup is not a good example. It is safe unless you ingest it and even after 45 years, evidence on it causing cancer is weak at best and a resounding no in other studies. It is probably safe even for professionals around it a lot, and definitely safe for occasional domestic garden usage.

This is why he's high profile.He had the audacity to challenge Biden. People who do that get smeared by the media to discredit them and protect JoeDebate, if you can’t hear any opposing views on a subject how can you ever make a decision for yourself.He also has a bunch of batshit crazy conspiracy views he likes to spout to get mouth breather's attention.You'd think that but when Trump was still in office and the covid shots rolled out at "warp speed", many of the same talking heads who are promoting the covid treatment now were very much saying that they don't know if it can be trusted. People like Biden, Harris, other Senators, and others in similar positions weren't on board until Biden was sworn in and then their rhetoric quickly changed to support their man as president.

It's funny how the same shots that came out under Trump was poo-pood but as soon as Biden got into office, "trust the science" and all that other nonsense was spouted off by the very same people who wouldn't trust it months prior. 

I guess those campaign donations really helped to quickly settle the science because it sure as shit wasn't the available scientific data 🙄... if it was, those people who changed their minds after the election wouldn't have had any reason to be wary of the shot in the first place seeing as nothing had changed. Either A) they were right to be skeptical or B) they were never skeptical in the first place and were publicly spouting those dangerous "anti-vax" views for political reasons...so which is it? Were they right to be skeptical of the covid shot or were they putting millions of people's lives at risk for political clout? If the answer is "B", should these people be trusted to hold the positions they do if they're going to put the citizenry in danger for their own gain?

Unfortunately, I doubt anyone will be held accountable for the immeasurable harm they helped to cause but I still hope to be pleasantly surprised 🤞And when he’s not carefully choosing his words. 

“They get the shot, that night they have a fever of 103 [degrees], they go to sleep, and three months later their brain is gone. This is a Holocaust, what this is doing to our country.” RFK jr in a public speech 12 April 2015.I haven't heard this story until now. I tried to look for it and I also couldn't find it. 

It seems that Hotez had a lot of deleted tweets. So maybe it was said and quickly deleted. 

When I first read this headline, I skimmed over it and thought it said "Perez Hilton" for some reason. 🤣> I could have done without that mental image

I was thinking of [another image](https://i.imgur.com/Wmz04ZO.png)Yes there are participants removed from trials or not accurately reported in the trials from basically every brand (probably all) with public stories of severe lasting issues. Brianne dressen (AZ), Maddie de Garay (pfizer) to name a coupleFor the Pfizer/BNT and Moderna phase 3 trials, as said, the difference is obviously not statistically significant (RR 1.05 [95% CI 0.50 to 2.20] and RR 1.00 [95% CI 0.50 to 2.00] respectively). J&J showed a significant decrease though (28 vs 55, RR 0.51 [95% CI 0.32-0.80]). If you pool the trials in a RE meta-analysis, the MA estimate shows a significant [reduction](https://i.redd.it/8ufwzj50tgta1.jpg). 

From this, it would be fallacious to conclude that 'the vaccine's effectiveness against death is statistically insignificant'; while there were clearly no statistically significant differences in the Pfizer trial and Moderna trial, they clearly don't rule out relevant effects (see the CIs). As mentioned, powering for a mortality endpoint is simply infeasible. It would take an unrealistic amount of participants and time, and the trial would never complete. You'd need like an n=400000 mega-RCT that takes place over years. However, post-marketing observational/population data *can* provide estimates for mortality. And outcomes like severe illness is a good proxy outcome for mortality (they were secondary endpoints in the trials, and there were statistically significant differences).Hey, I plan to live forever.
*(So far, so good)* 🙄Here's a pretty good video explaining the vaccine pyramid scheme.

https://odysee.com/vaccine-truths-vaccines-have-never-been-properly-safety-tested:9I’ve only recently learned that some of these trials use a “placebo” that is not a placebo, it can sometimes contain some of the real medication ingredients.

In this case, adjuvants.  I’m sure experts will argue that this is OK.  However, having to make that argument, having to justify this practice, this speaks volumes to the fact the trial has an acknowledged flaw which, maybe, can be accounted for in the results.  

toward safety it damages the credibility of the study.  OK for the effectiveness, sure, efficacy demonstrated.  Safety, when both groups receive the same adjuvants, both appear equal for harms observed, then the conclusion is required to discuss how the same adjuvants given to both groups cannot be contributing to the harm, which is impossible within the scope of the study.  Only possible to hand wave and suggest the ingredient is used elsewhere so it must be OK, even though the formulation under study is unique.

For example, consuming grapefruit is safe and effective.  Consuming certain pharmaceuticals is safe and effective.  Consume the grapefruit with certain pharmaceuticals is contraindicated, it is demonstrated to cause harm.  Consuming this adjuvant is safe,  but does it remain safe when combined with other ingredients?  Probably, you can bet your life on that probably.The biggest problem with vaccine hesitation is what you describe, the virus mutating within a community to evade the protection the vaccine is meant to give. The longer a virus remains within a population the more chances it has to "roll" a resistance to treatment. This is why herd immunity is vital so the virus spread is reduced, reducing the chances.

It's not perfect though. But, all we have is best guesses when it comes to novel disease anyway.Wrong. It stopped being used because it’s less effective than Pfizer and Moderna.

Big Pharma launches a huge ad salvo on CNN, Joe Rogan does a podcast with RFK, and the battlefield lines are redrawn as soldiers rise and fall from each sideHow about they just donate that money anyway.That doesn’t change any of what I said…What do you think it is? 

Dissertation defense is not a debate. It’s an oral presentation. The committee than will ask you a bunch of questions to ensure that you have solid knowledge and did your research on the topic. The “defending” part is just providing evidence for your thesis. 

Do you think the committee is trying to disprove your thesis?LOL as if the calibre of education that people participating in a dissertation defence is comparable to RFK or whomever else they are offering up. Nothing good can come of debating chimpsI didn’t say anything about who was right or who was wrong. I said that this is not how science is done and doesn’t prove anything. 

Science is done through studies and publishing studies. An oral debate does not show science, it shows who is a better public speaker. Debates in science happen via studies and evidence. RFK Jr has not done any studies, so how is his a scientific debate? What new scientific knowledge will he be bringing to this debate? If the answer is none, what’s the fucking point of doing it this way instead of just presenting the already existing studies that he has?What value did that debate create?

Also Bill Nye is a child’s entertainer who has trained for public speaking and discussing these things in simplest terms to children. Vaccine scientists are not trained like that.i dont know the subredit blackout mademe cleversmart"Watch the water" is scary even if you had Covid.Lol. Thanks. Your silly attempt to be foreboding failed. 
If I can ever get rumble to function properly I might watch it. I am gonna bet, before even seeing it, its absolute non sense, with 0 even barely credible verifiable repeatable facts. 

You have a nice life too. HahahahaThe Ministry of Truth for various world governments censored all dissenting vaccine data as "covid misinformation". And yet you paint Rogan as some sort of unfair arbiter of honest debate? Ironic. 

The anti-vax sentiment is not the group responsible for silencing their opposition from utilizing free speech with heavy-handed censorship and deplatforming. You're thinking of the people shilling for the vaccine you were easily fooled into injecting yourself with four times.Cringe response.

I want to know what is it about RFK that you dislike or lack trust in..None but why can't we hear his thoughts? We were forced to listen to Bill Gates for the past three years about COVID and he doesn't have a medical degree.Why is a medical degree necessary to have an opinion?He has an excellent excellent resume on environmental activism, but I'm not seeing any medical degrees. He does seem to be very well versed in medical history and is able to cite his sources on anything he claims.

It's not a bad point you make, yet i still think he has value.You shot down two doctors that were over qualified in the past, im not sure how this argument holds any warrant.>What medical degrees does RFK have?

Which do you have?But you care about what Joe Rogan says, and he's American. It seems what MSNBC and the US president says could be relevant to your comment.Then GTFO the thread. You don't even understand what the conversation is about.My bad buddy. Auto correct. You have definitely won the point you were making due to my critical error. Joe will totally debate the guy himself. I don't know what I was thinkingThat's why there is money being used as an incentive. A million dollars to charity doesn't help anyone? You're still not making sense.It’s not so much lying.

1. There is a lot of people paid to support it in online spaces. 

2. There are bots programmed to support it in posts convincingly.Rogan is filing for bankruptcy?You don't know how any of this works.I’m out of the loop here…rogan is paying a fine and filing for bankruptcy?aaah I see. I havent heard anything about her, just Mandy Cohen. It looks like in the article though that’s she’s not replacing Fauci, I think it’s a different position than what he held. Who knows.That got a chuckle out of me, thanks dude.I'm using this as an insult from now on

"You seem like a redditor"doesnt make their money fake, even if youre not wrongSomeone should stroll on by and snatch that easy money then?Okay….?

They’re still putting up money and saying they’d debate while the other side cowers and makes excuses. 

Looks like we know what side you fall into.*Hank Scorpio meme*

Of course!

I forgot the grifter's university, no wonder I'm getting downvotes.He has a cam girl website. Not exactly human traffickingThe side effects of the covid vaccines are well documented and included with the information about the vaccines. No one is pretending they don't exist. They are mostly very minor, with the possibility of very rare (roughly one in a 100k) serious side effects.The point is a vaccine needs decades of research and proper testing. 

To create a vaccine in months by bypassing most testing and develop then wanting to give it to every person on earth to fight a virus that isn't deadly to 95% of people is way too high risk of a move and feels really out of place.

It is fishy as fuck to say the least.> there is no remaining part 

> the only lasting part is 

Pick oneSo, it started out as 48hours and the body clears and now there have been tests that found it weeks later, and in places other than the injection site.The usual time for actual trials. 10+ years.You're correct; but Round Up is owned by Bayer, and was made by Mansato for decades. It was used on food crops intended for human consumption. 

Baby powder is made by Johnson and Johnson and was known to have asbestos in it for years before changing. And baby powder is also meant for common use by people. 

So arguably, these things that are made by companies that do make medicine can be tested to a similar level. And arguably should be, because they're like to be encountered by people more often than medicine.I've heard that its glyphosate that's safe, but the surfactants in roundup are the things that fuck you up....When was the last time they allowed Biden to debate?Of course you can always debate. But when the debate is an evolution v creationism debate, there will be nothing to gain.

A creationist can poke all the holes in other theories all they want. But they can't procure any falsifiable evidence because there is none. They may seem credible to the audience because the creationist is very charismatic, wel spoken an quick-witted. That doesn't make  evidence.

Just hearing an opposing view doesn't make the view any more or less true. You do that with the scientific method.That’s from him? 
“This is a holocaust”
Jesus ChristHows that not careful if its true?He writes about all this in a seemingly [deranged rant published by NATURE](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01084-x), which states:

>Halting the spread of the coronavirus will require a high-level counteroffensive against new destructive forces.

>Efforts must expand into the realm of cyber security, law enforcement, public education and international relations. A high-level inter-agency task force reporting to the UN secretary-general could assess the full impact of anti-vaccine aggression, and propose tough, balanced measures. The task force should include experts who have tackled complex global threats such as terrorism, cyber attacks and nuclear armament, because anti-science is now approaching similar levels of peril. It is becoming increasingly clear that advancing immunization requires a counteroffensive.

It’s been marketed from the start, specifically, around that very point. 

Care to explain what you mean?That was impressive, and even more incredible than I knew. No placebo group on any vaccine? What?Sure bud.

I’m pretty sure they are giving the OTHER guy a platform to fight the “misinfo” you claim they are spewing. Think about it. That makes no sense. If anything, if they are spewing disinfo to millions of people … it should be your DUTY to actively try and get someone you deem as “legitimate” on that platform to help even the conversation out and bring some facts and logic on it…right? Please try and tell me what I just said isn’t rational and reasonable.My point is

Big pharma has already won 

They have made billions.

Regular Joe taxpayer is screwed.Well if they do donate it anyway without him debating, it likely won't be to a charity Hotez gets to choose.“You are asking people who are trained in a lab to come on a live show….”- the part I’m referring to. My point is he goes on live shows to communicate medical advice from the scientific community, if anyone could debate a position on vaccines it would be him.You're wasting your time, these people have terrible reading comprehension. Notice how nothing you say ever gets directly addressed.It can get quite hostile depending on who is on the committee and that is just the first step. In any University each researcher is going to need to present their research. To their colleagues in the University, to other researchers at conferences and symposiums and then through text if and when the research is published.It's okay if you're afraid, I would be too if I put that crap into my body and then found out that it's potentially killing me. I know nervous laughter when I see it. All I can do is tell people to watch it with an open mind. If what those doctors found is wrong, then it's wrong. But if it's not, anybody who put that stuff into their bodies is essentially fucked. I don't have time to lie to people. And I also don't have time to force people to do anything. The truth will always be there in the end.I explained it real simple already. BB.https://nl.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/14crqvd/106_jfk_death_hoaxby_the_numbers/Oh shit. Who is preventing RFK from talkingLook at the comments I was replying to.It's because Joe is so popular I comment when he's wrong. I used to watch him before he became a jerk to justify his 100 million payday. Spreading disinformation is bad for everyone. Maddow is a corporate shill and Biden is worse than Trump FFS. The bar to lead the USA couldn't get any lower. Seriously, 350 million people and Biden and Trump for president is the best the corrupt partys have to offer? You're the one who should be angry.Who put you in charge? You GTFOWhy doesn't Rogan donate that money anyway? I guess he just doesn't want to help people?In support of the thesis of lying, those paid to state something as their own opinion are lying for money
 

The bots are relentless - what's the number reported for Twitter? I recall over 50%. Then those who disagree with the narrative are censored, so those voices are never heard nor counted. And then the many who remain quiet to avoid censorship, or bots giving them enough thumbs down to exceed the thumbs up.

In summary - I agree with all you all have said.He's literally calling for the military to stop Joe Rogan from debating? 

Scratch a liberal and a fascist bleedsDumb people: 'GIVE US ATTENTION, WE WILL GIVE YOU MONEY. YOU WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR MONEY LIKE WE DO RIGHT?'

Smart people: 'Naw, I don't think we should let more dumb/gullible people hear how dumb you are and make them feel confident'

You: 'Pshhh, fucking cowards'When you traffic the women on your cam girl website, it kinda isConvincing women that you want to marry them, convincing them to move across the world to be with you, then when they get there you convince them to do cam work and lie to them about their earnings and take 75% of it because "taxes" all while not actually even paying taxes is basically the definition of human trafficking

He bragged about how none of them had ever done camgirl work before*"no one is pretending"*

You must be new to reddit. You don't get to flip the narrative now. Yes people were pretending that what i just said was some right wing conspiracy. Trust me I got into a lot of arguments over this.

2 years ago, people were wishing death upon you if you spoke out against the vaccine btw, some still are. If a person can do that, you better be damn sure they could pretend a lot of stuff.

A big difference too, is with other vaccines people aren't forced to take ones that aren't ready for humans yet. This time people were essentially forced to take a medication that was not ready.

Thats a pretty big jump from a flu shot that had all the kinks worked out, vs a medicine that was cooked up in a few months, that you had to get or no more normal life for you.Yeah, OK tell that to my uncle who died from his. So safe.To me the real issue comes when they force people to get it or to lose their jobs / not be able to travel>	virus that isn’t deadly to 99.9997% of people

FtfyWell, and also, the covid jab is not a vaccine in the traditional sense, it's targeted gene therapy.A vaccine being delayed for years sort of defeats the purpose of vaccinating against a pandemic-level disease, doesn't it?

Next, there will be a virus with a much higher kill rate and people still will be screaming it needs more testing.Vaccines do not need decades of research and testing. But, if they did, you should be comforted that the type of vaccine used by Pfizer did indeed have decades of research and testing behind it.*The only lasting part is the part that failed testing for 30+ years because it killed the majority of animals it was tested on.The mRNA is the lasting effect and produced by your body. It's not part of the vaccine."There is no remaining part" of the vaccine.

"The only lasting part is" the way your body now produces mRNA. It will now fight the virus better.What is "it"?

And what studies?It leaves the blood but can hole-punch the blood brain barrier, the LNPs find their way to nearly every organ, and the PEG/Mercury/adjuvants can be found all over the body for up to 20 years later. The MRNA part isn't the bad part of the COVID ones, it's the spike that's dangerous, which is made more dangerous when natural immune system functions are bypassed (e.g. nasal/lung systems), not to mention there's a 10% it is incorrectly administered and becomes intravenous instead of intramuscular (which is far more likely when Walmart employees are giving it out compared to trained physicians).The aforementioned post mentioned problems 20 years later.

Imagine if this was your attitude with all new technology.  You would only be willing to use computers and other technology that is ten years old or MORE.Again you're attempting to compare regular prolonged exposure to something most people got once, maybe twice, 3 years ago. 

If you were talking about applying the covid Vax every day for 4 years you might have a good comparison, but thats simply not the case.All the farmers around here who would spray roundup with open tractors no cabs died from cancer. It blew all over them plus breathed the mist in. But back then everyone said it was such a safe herbicide no precautions were needed.A long time ago. The Republican party has pledged not to allow any presidential debates.

The Republican party is going all out on not having any debates to see Biden talking.When he could talk he spouted hateful nonsense.False equivalence. 

Debates are part of the scientific method.Publicly debating the efficacy and safety of vaccines made by for profit corporations with a long history of straight up lying, broad deceptions and other reckless disregard for human life is, in your mind, nowhere near the same realm of reality as arguing for creationism, come on.  It's funny (actually sad) that you even remotely associate the two in your mind. If you do, they've got your mind by the balls, so to speak.How is this an evolution be creation debate at all?There’s also no evidence to evolution either. Hence why it’s a theory.I like a lot of the things RFK is talking about but he uses too much hyperbole which kinda ruins the bits I like. He isn’t a medical professional so he misreads information and then goes and spreads his misunderstanding around because people listen to him.Gotta report to the UN 🙄. I see why this guy was the one for the job.Christ he really went in. When I read the title of this post I thought it would be some vague reference to military action being loosely associated with suppressing skepticism. I truly underestimated this asshole.Dude, fuck Hotez, but this article is from April 2021. How is this relevant to the Rogan tweet in the OP?oh i’ll go on a little more too, how about “MK ULTRA” where we tested LSD on US civilians. How about the “Tuskegee Experiment”. What about “Operation Mockingbird”…. wake up people.Thank you bro, actually just booked my 7th shot (the new hexavalent jab)Safe and effective in regard to reducing deaths, reducing infection spread, reducing severity of symptoms.  This is what I recall from the various leaders speaking on the subject of the marvelous new mRNA technology.  Very exciting!

So this trial showed it was not so much effective at reducing deaths, is that the claim?.  

Perhaps all these good things I heard have been debunked too, this trial seems to suggest a debunking, dudinit?10 years? Reddit will be dead by then.Only one at that point was a small placebo group for the gardasil vaccine. And it apparently [didn't go well.](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gardasil-researcher-speaks-out/)Yeah, and they all resumed using it after it was found safe. Clown.

https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2021-03-19/astrazeneca-covid-vaccinations-resume-germany-after-blood-clot-scareIf nothing should be mandated, does that mean you don’t believe that truck drivers should be limited from driving over a certain number of hours in one stint? Or that construction workers working in dangerous gear should be mandated to take a water break? Or that we should mandate people not speeding or drink and drive? Should we not mandate that a person with tuberculosis should quarantine?It is still forbidding my approval of the comment.

One of those two are banned site-wide. 

Try deleting and creating new comments, then logging out after commenting.  If you can see it while logged out, it went through. If not, try again.I take it you're amused by how easy it is to achieve "scientific consensus" when you fire, punish and censor the scientists who disagree.> Lol

Lol?

There are many domains that are blocked by Reddit filters for a variety of reasons -- and you would likely not agree with all of their filtering decisions. 

Some we can approve, some we can not.That’s ok. Any charity will do.He doesn’t go on and do political debates. He can communicate information. There’s a differenceThe man is literally a public speaker how am I not addressing anything he saysPresenting their research is fine. All of the information present in this theoretical debate on the Rogan podcast has already been presented and made it’s way around the scientific community. 

What does doing a live debate with RFK Jr do to increase the knowledge of the scientific community? Wouldn’t the best thing to do here is have RFK Jr publish his findings that run counter to the vaccine scientist and see if any of  them can refute it? That’s how science is done.Lol when exactly am I fucked? Huh? You dont know shit and your school yard “oh you will see” bullshit does not impress or scare anyone. 

Your a fuckin weirdo. But thanks for the content.Just go watch CNN. Forget about it.https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/3472878-joe-bidens-ministry-of-truth/Honey, I've lived in Dallas all my life... I'd give anything for him to have not been killed.

 [But, The man's brains ended up on Elm St. ](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYZDVcX7waw5MEMHj1azuemYwG8Z3h3CD)Not so much preventing him from talking as much as being heard and not misunderstood.That doesn't answer the question.No objection here about Trump or Biden. It's just funny because Joe Rogan uses his $100M voice to go against establishment voices, even if he's wrong sometimes. He was the most popular endorsement for Bernie Sanders.This is why nobody likes CanadiansYou have no idea what's going on1) You don't know what Rogan does or does not donate.

2) How would you suggest he incentivize Hotez?Do you have a link? Google search doesn’t pull up any info of Joe Rogan being fined a billion dollars and filing for bankruptcy.>2 years ago, people were wishing death upon you if you spoke out against the vaccine btw, some still are.

Yep. Not to mention if you said "I am already high risk for X known side effect, and low risk for covid itself, I elect for MY health to wait on the vaccine until one with a better risk/benefit ratio for ME comes out" you could lose your job, access to stores, etc.It is a right wing conspiracy theory. The covid vaccine is as safe as other vaccines, meaning extremely safe.[Just gonna leave this incredibly long layperson's youtube video debunking how Andrew Wakefield's initial vaccine + autism study was almost entirely falsified after a lawyer paid him to fabricate some scientific paper that could be used to win a class action lawsuit against vaccine manufacturers, while simultaneously patenting his own type of Measles vaccine which he would use to financially enrich himself with by competing directly with the MMR vaccine that he has made a career out of trying to discredit.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BIcAZxFfrc)

Ground zero for the modern antivaxx movement is and always has been a couple of charlatans.

My favorite part is when people chime in with 'science' and 'data' but don't link to any primary sources and have themselves never read or contributed to an actual scientific white paper in their life.  If you don't know what the NEJM or an impact factor are, maybe you shouldn't be parroting your aunt's facebook posts.

Also note that I'm not trying to claim these medicines are all without risk.  But I'd rather defer my opinion to the analysis of the doctors with thousands of hours of expertise and education in these areas over jimbo bob who barely made it through High School.Sure he did. And my uncle is the CEO of Nintendo.If all the dictionaries just change the definition of what a vaccine is, then the jab is a vaccine.

Oh wait, that's exactly what they did!That's sort of a disingenuous argument. Anything humans set out to "invent" doesn't work before it doesAnd the vaccine causes your body to make that very same mRNA, ergo the vaccine causes the lasting effects.So please believe the establishment that all of the bad ingredients in the vax go away, and you're only left with the positive ones inside your body.


Bahahaha RFK even went into the mercury they use in vax and how they claim there's a "safe type of mercury" that leaves your blood in a week. Unfortunately it never leaves the brain, and damage is permanent.

Most diseases we vax for are old world that we can easily treat the causes and effects for nowadays.

RFK 2024!!!Anti-vaxxers hate this one simple factWhat a stupid argument… completely stupid. Wtf does new technology have to do with a vaccine that if basically forced on a population? 

What does technology like brushless motors, computer chips, fuel injection, or any other type new technology have to do with a vaccine that is injected into someone’s body?You don't inject acomputer in to your veins ding dong haha.... sillyNobody is forcing people to get injected with computers…No but an un known injection should continually be vetted and learned more about. Side effects that are deadly can come from everything. I never said don’t use it. I said don’t stop testing a making sure it actually is safe.I see where you're arguing, but there's still a duration of time needed for quality of testing.

Testing 100k patients over a month doesn't necessarily equal the same results as 10k patients over a year. Cancers and adverse reactions don't show up as quickly as a poison or allergy. 

Albeit there's other ethics in play if a test is shown to be considerably better in the short term.

My statement was meant to show that the examples given by a different commenter should be tested to a similar scrutiny as medicine. The baby powder example being a big one where manufacturers knew of the risks and still didn't fix it. Round Up I'm not as familiar with, but given the history of Monsanto, I wouldn't be surprised if it was known and ignored.No they’re not.

ETA: “debate” is not part of the scientific method. Peer review, testing, and studies are. If you think the findings of a study or test are wrong, you run the experiment yourself and compare results.Reminds me of a recent president. Not the older bumbling one either.I’m confused, where are people concluding this amounts to an argument for military action?Not just US civilians, they tortured Canadian civilians in Montreal too as part of the program.Reddit may go downhill and become fully dogshit but it'll never "die".Two weeks later and it was suspended again. Clotty shotty in your body. Honk Honk!

*edit: by late April of 2021, over 25 countries had implemented restricted use of the AstraZeneca vax because of safety concerns. 

https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/some-countries-limit-astrazeneca-vaccine-use-eu-findings-jj-shot-expected-2021-04-20/Lots of questions in here, but basically, there is a difference between mandates and regulations.Oh. Well, if phmpt is banned, I give up because they're the ones who actually went to court to force Pfizer to release the data.

It's not as if the person I was "debating" with had any intention of reading the documents anyway.The grifting scientists like Malone, McCullough and doctors like Kory got far more public attention than any real virologist or immunologist. All over Rogan, etc…It’s a debate on vaccines, not politicsOne reason people insist that you use the proper channels to change things is because they have control of the proper channels and they’re confident it won’t workYou just say dumb shit and then act like I am crazy? Wtf is a ministry of truth. Show me USAs? Show me Canadas? 

Im down for some tinfoil. But bring me something.Bullshit. it was to implement trauma on the people. look up ed chiarini. JFK is alive today as jimmy carter. Honey...He went on the largest podcast in the world. How is he not being heard? If he wants to be understand, he should talk better.Rogan could just donate that money. He isn't because he is a piece of shit and this is just a publicity stunt.Wear an American flag when you leave the country. Then wear a Canadian flag when you leave the country. See which flag gets you more respect.That money just proves this isn't a good faith request.no one believes you, go do something else with your time.Do you really think doctors are sitting there using droppers and vials and doing studies themselves, or do you think they are reading curated numbers off of pages of information that tells them what to think?

These people aren't doing research like a person imagines. but congrats you found an article that has nothing to do with the covid vaccine, and are blanketing all vaccines being the same thing, and we're the jimbo bobs? If two people stand under the same umbrella, are they the same person?

Talk about apples and oranges.Glad you agree, would be monstrous to deny a death because you are a corporate tool.Yes....... that's what a vaccine does"Thimerosal contains a different form of mercury called ethylmercury. Studies comparing ethylmercury and methylmercury suggest that they are processed differently in the human body. Ethylmercury is broken down and excreted much more rapidly than methylmercury. Therefore, ethylmercury (the type of mercury in the influenza vaccine) is much less likely than methylmercury (the type of mercury in the environment) to accumulate in the body and cause harm.

Because the names of these two chemicals vary by only a single letter, it is difficult to believe they could be very different; however, if you think about ethanol and methanol (also known as ethyl alcohol and methyl alcohol), you will see that the difference can be dramatic – ethanol is what we drink at a party, whereas methanol, added to some types of gasoline and antifreeze, is poisonous if consumed."

Make sure you read that second paragraph really slowly.Which private individual has been forced to be vaccinated? Can you name one?Is it though?

Medical technology is TECHNOLOGY.

Suppose a company is looking to make a faster microchip.  Do you think that they start from square one, or do you think that they build their technology onto previous technology that they know is effective?

The same thing holds true with medical technology.  Scientists work to modify or build on previous technology that they know is safe and effective.

&#x200B;

A lot of technology that we see today may feel new, but almost all of it is built on old, tested technology.Yes, Pookie Bear.  You don’t inject computers into your veins.  This may sound crazy, but check this out.  Not all technology involves computers.Is 11% of the world population a large enough sample sizeWhat about when the peers reviewing the science have a monetary incentive to affirm the science? Thats how the current system works.Don't be using that voodoo science with these people.You don't believe there are debates? Did you learn that on the internet?A high-level inter-agency task force who have tackled complex global threats such as terrorism, cyber attacks and nuclear armament is what was called for.

After 40 years of feeling foolish about weird things I've believed in regards to conspiracies I am thankful there are people like you that make me look brilliant.True but people still quote obviously skewed articles about him.You don't have to believe anything I say, the documentation is widely available and you can check for yourself. That's the fun thing about reality.You really only wanted research scientists to be the only people administering the shot? Do you think supply could keep up with demand?I am saying you're full of shit, yeah.I think I read it slowly enough.....

 I understand your comparison to "good" alcohol vs. "bad" alcohol. I also already understand that ALL alcohol is toxic to the human body. 

Why do you feel hungover the next day? You're literally poisoning yourself. Ethyl alcohol breaks down in the human body as acetaldehyde.

"First, ADH metabolizes alcohol to acetaldehyde, a highly toxic substance and known carcinogen"

All mercury (and alcohol) is toxic and neurodegenerative.



https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/aa72/aa72.htmYeah take this or lose your job. Seems pretty forceful.Being told that I had to take the vaccine or I was not allowed in my customers facilities is considered being forced.  I took the job long before Covid was a thing and was not part of my terms of employment.  

Being told I have to choose between a high paying job (that I was at the time buying into the company) or getting a vaccine is being forced.

It is 100% considered being forced. I am the only one that works in my household, I support 2 kids, my wife and her 2 grandparents. I can not simply replace my job. 

I am a specialist in a specific field. That caters to specific companies.  My job is not a dime a dozen. The crazy part about all of this is 3 months after I had to get vaccinated the state dropped its mandate. 

I don’t care what your opinion in about being forced. If I have to completely change my livelyhood, the dynamics of my family, where I live, how I live, change how my kids (both special needs) get help and care, then I am forced to take the vaccine.Yeah there is zero potential harm to upgrading a micro chip. There is zero harm to a completely redesigned micro chip.

The Covid vaccine was never tested thoroughly. It could not have been. There were zero generational tests ran on the Covid vaccine.

Rmna technology has never been used in humans so there is zero chance they built off of existing technology to give to humans. And considering not once did a rmna vaccine ever pass the safety protocols. So your argument makes zero senseSemantics.

There's a reason why Socrates thought that rhetoric is legitimately evil. You're not making a reasoned point here, you're just pretending to be smarter than the other guy in order to seem credible. Its...impotent, at best.I’m not arguing the system is perfect. There’s definitely room for improvement. That improvement is not politically motivated individuals who don’t understand the material arguing on stage.I know, I know; I only bring pain upon myself.Debates don’t settle hypotheses. Studies do. If someone doesn’t agree with the result, they run the experiment themselves and publish it for critique and review.Yes? Experts involved in intelligence, cyber security, etc. does not equate to “military intervention” like people here are saying. Saying he’s asking for military intervention sounded pretty severe when I heard it, but then saw the quote and was just pretty underwhelmed.

Even if it did involve people with prior military experience, that doesn’t equate to “military intervention.” It’s just not what he’s calling for.Well, I appreciate your effort, and presumably now they're up so chuckleburger can check them out if he or she is so inclined. Thanks!Weird, he is a subject matter expert and there is 1.5 mil committed to a charity.   He has cnn and msnbc to scream horse paste.   He has 100 different fact checkers to immediately discredit rfk and spout the party line.   He has google and chat gpt to scream misinfo.     

Not going on screams way louder then losing a debate.truth is stranger than fiction. Keep patting yourself on the back.but what if i had documentation that was contrary to yours, whos is true?

peer reviewed studies and write ups done by independent credible doctors?

or the articles written by the pharmaceutical industry and the very entities pushing the vaccine?Dude you can’t come here and make a MSM parroted comment. Go do some research on both sides of the topic and come back. Or you are on the wrong sub. 
At least watch the RFK jr / Joe Rogan podbut its true, the vaccines cause heart issues, and were given to the public way too early. it would have had side effects regardless, but given how little testing was done the side effects legit include death.

now imagine a government mandating and shaming people for not wanting to inject themselves with death.

get it yet?Yeah, and I'm saying you have become a corporate controlled monster.A monetary incentive is not "forced vaccination." Like anything else if you don't like the terms of your employment, you can get a job somewhere else.Nope. You're free to get a job somewhere else. And for the record I'm 100% onboard with requiring employees in certain industries to be vaccinated. Same reason I'm fully onboard with requiring hand washing in certain industries.This is purely a bad faith argument.  When your standard is “zero potential for x,” it literally nullifies everything.

If Kraft creates a new jar to can their vegetables, you can’t say that there is a zero potential for harm that bacteria couldn’t get in the new jars.  In fact, you can’t say that there is a zero percent chance that something could go wrong with the old ones.  It might be wise to not eat at all because jars, as a whole, have a higher than zero percent contamination rate.

Do you stop at a green light?  Well you should.  Did you really think that there’s zero potential that a traffic light may not work properly?

It is almost laughable that you want generational testing.  Imagine living your whole life safely, but is there zero potential that it won’t cause defects in your children, grandchildren, great grandchildren, great-great grandchildren.

You’ve effectively built an impossible standard.How do you improve the system? By re-electing the same politicians that perpetuate it? By listening to the media that defends it? By listening to the hivemind of scientists that are spit out of universities pargely funded by pharmaceutical companies? Because thats what we're currently doing, and any attempt to stray from that path is shrugged off as "crackpot, grifter conspiracy nonsense." Isn't that just a bit convenient?

What is the best path forward, in your opinion?And they debate their findings on what might be the difference in what was found.There is much more in the article as well. Did you read it?

>The United Nations and the highest levels of governments must take direct, even confrontational, approaches with Russia, and move to dismantle anti-vaccine groups in the United States.

Also, he could have said more in other articles or interviews as well. I have no idea if this article is what other people are referring to in their comments about him or not.So you think whoever is a better debater changes the science? If someone who believes in globe earth but has a stutter and messes up while presenting and loses a debate to a flag earther, does that make the planet flat? 

Do you know what screams loudly? The fact that RFK and Rogan are too scared to take on Vaccine scientists in the vaccine scientists court. Surely you see that as proof that they are wrong? Or does your logic only apply one way?I will...

When I figure out that I'm wrong about something, that someone lied to me or made a video I thought was true (but isn't).

I admit when I'm wrong...

I'm sorry that you're not self-reflective enough to do that.>but what if i had documentation that was contrary to yours, whos is true?

>peer reviewed studies and write ups done by independent credible doctors?

You don't have that though.

>or the articles written by the pharmaceutical industry and the very entities pushing the vaccine? 

Just saying "pharmaceutical industry" doesn't mean anything to anyone who doesn't think they're magical boogymen. The pharmaceutical industry does a ton of research and are one of the largest sources of data because guess what, *they're the experts on pharmaceuticals.*

And yeah, they push vaccines because *they work.*The "articles" written by the pharmaceutical industries are peer reviewed...do you think we waited 2020 to realize some kind of double check would be a good idea before any drug gets on the market...If watching a podcast is your idea of research then I have some very bad news about your scientific literacy.Making up false accusations about people who disagree with you is I'm sure an easy way to tackle that cognitive dissonance.GFY. When the govt is also coercing private businesses and shutting them down for non-compliance, it’s not voluntary.Coercion takes many forms, you gaslighting stooge.So I went to school for years and spent years moving up and they can just say, whelp, take this or else? This is life changing and absolutely forced.You don't inject handwashing into your body. Also you can sue if the soap gives you a side effect...So in my situation. The employees of our customers were not required to be vaccinated. Visitors were not required to be vaccinated. But the state pushed the companies to require subcontractors to be vaccinated.  

This was in dr offices, biotech, and medical research facilities. So when you can make that make sense let me know.The Covid vaccine was never tested for generational side effects in mice, rabbits, monkeys, or anything else. You don’t find that strange? 

I expect any vaccine testing to run its course in animal testing before being pushed into a human population.  

Lol it’s one thing to trust a stop light. It’s another to trust a new vaccine technology that never was used on humans before. And the new vaccine technology was not even fully tested on animals. I accept the risk of some things. This is not one of them.You can tell he's a dumbass because microchips can 100% cause bodily harm in many different ways. Bombs, air filters, or whatever other mostly harmless tech can go from harmless to deadly by flipping the value of a single variable.Universal healthcare is a good start. For profit healthcare incentivizes pharmaceutical companies to maximize profits and market their products. 

Increase funding to public schools to increase scientific literacy is another good way to change the system. 

And scientists are definitely not a hive mind. There is very strong debate over many subjects. Scientists just know better than to speak about subjects outside their own expertise, and trust their colleagues to produce accurate material.Fair enough. But the result of any discussion will be further testing and study with refined methods, and the discourse is between qualified individuals, not politicians, or whoever Joe Rogan finds.Yeah I’ve been busy for Fathers Day and haven’t had a chance to do the thorough read I’d like to and plan to later, but from what I’ve seen quoted and on a couple Google searches, there’s just no mention of “military action/intervention” people are saying he’s advocating for. Governmental/intergovernmental and diplomatic actions, sure, but militant actions I just don’t see mentioned, hence asking where others are seeing it.Im sorry you are not willing to dig deeper than the official conspiracy tells you.*"You don't have that though."*

There are lots of those articles surfacing. you just wouldn't read them if someone linked them. It doesn't mean they don't exist. you have your bubble of information that you stay inside and anything else you disregard because you risk popping that bubble.

Not to mention at certain point circumstantial evidence is enough to convict someone of a crime, there are too many stories that have come out that go against the vaccine for me not to believe them.

You need to hang around here longer, without blabbing. because at least once a week an article is posted that shows the negative side effects of the vax. and how the benefits do not outweigh the risks. Especially for a "pandemic" that has like 99% survivability for most people.

"*And yeah, they push vaccines because they work."*

Like i said the jig is up, no one believes this anymore. its ok to admit you were wrong.i dont know what you are saying im sorry.

when i say peer reviewed, i mean people who have no reason to lie when they write an article, they have no vested interest in diluting the truth for fear of losing a job or any position in society.

i might have misspoke? but people know what i mean.The entire post is about RFK Jr debating his ideas with someone of the other side. I am perceiving you to not know the nuances of RFK’s argument.Denying someone's lived experience because it contradicts your corporate messaging seems like a good example of cognitive dissonance.I'm fine with people being "coerced" into taking lifesaving and safe vaccines. Just like I'm fine with them being "coerced" into wearing seatbelts. Forcefully vaccinating crosses the line with me because I believe in the right to bodily autonomy but no one has been arrested or held down for not getting vaccinated.No, forced is when someone uses force on you. Like holding you down or threatening jail time.So?

And you're free to sue whomever you want if you can prove medical malpractice, and that includes Pfizer et al. The law you're referring to prevents you from suing for unintended harm. There is financial compensation available through
 https://www.hrsa.gov/vaccine-compensation

If you can prove that you sustained an injury from the vaccine.MRNA technology was tested on animals in the 2010s.  Again, you’re building on previous technology that was already proven safe and effective.We will never get any of that stuff by just trusting whatever corporations and their scientists spit out. 

Science is just as ruthless and game theoretical as any other business. Scientists try to paint their peers as crackpots all of the time.But how else do we get information being debated Public so that the everyday joe can make their decision without money blinding the bad parts that they don’t want public.He calls people who question the safety or efficacy of any vaccines mass murderers, extremists, anti-science, on par with the proud boys, terrorists, January 6th protestors, and engaged in a war against science. He wants the DHS involved and the UN. Lots of hot buzz words even using words like "confrontational". 

What department would **confront** **mass murdering extremists** on par with **terrorists** on a **war** against science? He's a smart guy, choosing his emotionally reactive manipulative words wisely in this nature article.I'm more than willing to dig into who actually blew his brains out. But you are absolutely correct I'm not insane enough to think that the man is still alive...>robert malone

Lol. The guy that had to rescind his allegations because it turned out they were based on doctored video footage? The guy who admitted he got the Moderna vaccine? That Robert Malone?

>like i said the jig is up, no one believes this anymore. its ok to admit you were wrong. 

Actually just about everyone believes it, because it's true. You're in the fringe minority, you're just surrounded by similar company in this sub due to selection bias.I'm not interested in anyone's argument on either side. People say all kinds of shit. I'm interested in robust, scientifically vigorous, statistically significant peer reviewed data. Does he have any?Seatbelts can be unbuckled and adjusted, and a small fine is the punishment for not wearing one.

Requiring someone to inject a foreign substance just to keep their livelihood is some bona fide Harvey Weinstein logic.Take this or lose your job. That’s forced. Do it or else.If it was proven safe and effective then we would of had  mRNA vaccines years ago. Not emergency use. There was zero generational testing on the Covid vaccine… and to be completely honest we didn’t need a rushed out vaccine for Covid. It was not even that deadly. We could of saved more lives. By promoting healthy lifestyle with proper exercise, nutrition and relaxation.  We didn’t need a vaccine we needed politicians with a backboneYou’re correct, we will have to vote in strong leaders who prioritize education and other important issues, and demonetize higher education to some extent to achieve these goals.That’s a different argument you’re making. Scientific progress should be open and accessible to the public, but circus debates by people with aggressive agendas are not the answer.Where does he call them mass murderers on par with terrorists? Saying people addressing it should be familiar with complex tasks such as addressing terrorists is again, not the same as calling them terrorists. Calling them anti-science is, well, from his perspective as a well-researched scientist, fair. 

This whole “you just have to read between the lines for what he really means” answer for my question of where he is arguing for “military action/intervention” is a bit of a leap.i corrected myself before finishing my comment, so you can get off your high horse.

I find it hilarious how you guys will always find one thing in a comment and latch onto it instead of addressing the common sense point im trying to make.

its like you have to be right all the time. its such a binary way of existing i feel bad for you.First of all, it wasn’t rushed.  It took about a year to test.

Second of all, you don’t think a healthy lifestyle hasn’t been promoted prior to COVID?  Exercise, heath products, and health related products are multi-billion industries.  Most states require students to take health classes.  You can’t just pretend that these things were not previously happening.I feel like you are missing the point. When we are given the choice to vote for such a leader, they are dismissed by the establishment.Yes they are. A more knowledgeable person should be able to constructively shut the other person down>Where does he call them [mass murderers on par with terrorists](https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1602991915808456705)?

“Anti-vaxxer activism, which I also call anti-scientific aggression – has become the main **murderous force on a global scale.** During the Covid pandemic in the United States, 200,000 Americans needlessly lost their lives because they refused the Covid vaccine, even after vaccines became available to everyone. And now, anti-vaxxer activism is spreading around the world, even in middle- and low-income countries. That’s killing power. **The anti-science current kills more people today than armed violence, global terrorism, nuclear proliferation or cyber attacks.** And that has now turned into a political movement that is associated with right-wing extremism in America. The same thing is happening in Germany. So this is the new face of anti-scientific aggression. Therefore, we need political solutions to solve it.”Your "common sense point" is literally just an incorrect opinion and blabber. If you want to cite a credible source then put up or shut up.

Here, find something in here that supports your opinion: https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C23&q=covid+19+vaccine&oq=covid+19

Be my guest.And the Covid vaccine was not tested for a year. Lol they didn’t even finish their placebo tests. They never tested for transmissibility. They didn’t test for a lot of stuff. They did more experimental testing on humans than animals. Let that sink in.


Not one government was saying that the most people hospitalized were over weight and had vitamin D deficiency.  

Kids were not affected by Covid.. I wonder if because they are more active than adults and dr and adults want kids to drink milk. Parents send their kids out side to get away for a bit.

Maybe if the government put energy into encouraging adults to be more active and exercise more. Get more sunlight, eat better.  But not once did they do that.  Instead they shut down gyms, encouraged people to order out via delivery services, and wanted people to hide from each other..I don’t disagree with you, but name one candidate who is “anti-vax” who is also for increased education spending or universal healthcare? What does RFK Jr say about those issues?People rarely change their minds when proven wrong. That’s kind of the basis of this sub.You are just in too deep, im not going to bother with you, you believe lies and propaganda.

If you require an easy answer with a simple google search, then that's fine. If you think the mainstream information isn't controlled to push a narrative, that's fine.

I'm not going to though, and i shouldn't be forced to trust liars, or else i can't go to work. Its not my fault, i didn't lie on record hundreds of times, that was our governments.

I feel like im trying to explain quantum physics to an ant right now.They tested the vaccine as they went.  I don’t understand why, during a global pandemic, you would think that it was imperative to test the placebo.  Do you think that a sugar pill was gonna prevent COVID?  Why would you not be willing to waive that during a pandemic?

The government has for years promoted healthy living.  Nutritional information is placed on every food with its percentage to daily consumption listed.  As students, they take health classes and are required to take physical education classes.  People KNOW obesity is dangerous and can tell you the effects of obesity.  The general population is absolutely aware of the effects.Hey, I'm totally open minded about looking at your supposed evidence of the dangers of the covid vaccines. May I see this supposed evidence or are you just going to repeat more drivel about how I'm "brainwashed" while you're "secretly enlightened."ChatGPT knows what's up.###[Meta] Sticky Comment

Its not a theory any more, i find it hilarious that people haven’t connected the dates of when mk ultra started and “ended” with the realease of mainstream entertainment and television. What i want people to understand is that everything on this list was at one point deemed a lie made up by crazy theorists. Forming their own opinions through independent research was what I thought was the basis of a sub group like this here.They stopped doing all of that shady stuff and are following the law now duh!!!Edward Snowdens revelations is the most hilarious thing to happen in America.

The only thing Edwards Snowden revelation pointed out is how gullible the American collective is.  We treated his "revelations" as "news" despite everything he said was revealed openly in 2001 when the patriot act passed...

Goes to show how many people actually bought into the stupidity of "if you're not a terrorist you have nothing to worry about." In regards to the bipartisan Patriot act.  "When do the two parties ever agree on anything!?". That's one probably even better than the terrorist one.Who has info on project stargate? I’ve seen the basics but have never done a deep diveAmerican people paid for all of them.can we ask it about who controls the money. I’ve heard it’s not really nice referring to whitesSome of these aren't conspiracies... Operation Paperclip? Does anyone actually believe that didn't happen? The Manhattan Project? Come on...So we’re posting memes now. 
People in general should learn how ChatGPT works and stop using ChatGPT as a source of truth.I've recently read two books with details of these projects. One was called "Debunked" by Casey Lytle and the other was called "Stuff They Don't Want You To Know" by Ben Bowlin. 

Both books had a similar spin: 1) here are things that people thought were conspiracies; 2) turns out they were true; 3) but that doesn't mean that any current conspiracy is true.

Call me skeptical.And down the rabbit hole i go, wish me luck!This means nothing. AI only generates words based off the words used in the prompt. It’s all made up.SS: I asked chat g p t to list me 20 conspiracy theories that turned out to be true, This is what it spit out.Syphilis is on there twice. Pretty popular conspiracy subject but it never comes up here.If you want to have no government-sponsored conspiracies all you have to do is eliminating the CIA and other intelligence agencies.  I don't know how many the U.S. government have.The list is fine but this doesn't fit the sub and maybe belongs elsewhere.“Some” basis in truth. Mfer literally all of those should be in history books at this point.I wonder how A.I. will change its prompts now that things like Vaccine efficiency are about to change and we’ll see how terrible they are

Will it learn and change automatically as mainstream narratives change or will it still call “antivaxers” conspiracy theorists?It's interesting that Tuskegee were famous airmen also. Like the name was used as a cover for someone looking into Tuskegee info.Nice iv been looking for a conspirafacts list for agesPosts like this are about 3 months old

haven't even the non-techies figured out how ChatGPT works yet, as a regurgitation of statistically probable responses based on the input it was fed, and the actions it was fine-tuned to takeYeah, but they would like never do anything like ever again 😬But I'm sure the Gov tells us the truth nowI have found with both gpt and bard they both have a bias to favor the narratives of corporations/elite institutions. GPT much more so than Bard. To the point where it was clearly biased almost to the point of being dismissive/patronizing. That’s actually why I started using bard. Even bard was not fully forthcoming, sort of selectively omitting information I knew to be true. So I prompted again asking why that information was omitted and the response was that while it’s true, it’s a controversial issue that is also complicated that must people struggle to understand.

There was nothing complicated about the question I asked. I asked about the current shortage of adhd medication and was given the typical answer that msm has been pumping out - increased telehealth, supply chain issues, staffing issues, etc. No mention of the algorithms being used by corporations that are cutting off pharmacies from class 2 medications (anxiety, stimulants, opiates, etc) based off of some arbitrary number without any human review, almost as a sort of malicious compliance to the multi-state ag lawsuits against opiate manufacturers for creating the opioid epidemic.

There’s nothing complicated about that. It’s only controversial insofar as our government institutions have been completely captured by corporations.Let's all just move forward now. We know mistakes were made, but the intentions were good, so we all can learn from this and be better in the future. The past does not predict the future and everything is different now so don't worry. Carry on.If you look at the entry for false flag on Wikipedia, the entire page doesn't once mention the Gulf of Tonkin Incident but there's claims (quoting sources like The Guardian) that Russia used a false flag to invade Ukraine lol. The bias and propaganda on Wikipedia is crazy.Don't forget to vote, it's important.>"What i want people to understand is that everything on this list was at one point deemed a lie made up by crazy theorists. "

True.  

They'd throw people into institutions (ironically ones conducting mk ultra experiments) for talking about "crazy" things like government conducting mind control experiments on citizens.  

Hell mk ultra even went beyond our borders and it's till not taken very serious to this day.

Here's fellow five eyes member Canada on the topic.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/canadian-government-gag-order-mk-ultra-1.4448933

>"Forty years after revelations that the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency funded brainwashing experiments on unsuspecting Canadians, the Trudeau government is continuing a pattern of silencing the victims, a lawyer for one of the families says."

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=990k-5Jm5aASame with project lifeline. Ended feb 4 2004. Facebook started feb 4 2004. 

People are doing the governments spy work.yeah like a lot of this shit is kinda proven, just none of the fucks that committed it will ever talk about it.i think a lot of people understand that our entertainment is the baby ok mk ultra. but it's just a really successful program. probably the best work the government has ever doneIndeed. Mkultra never ended. It became more covert thanks to technology. One instance of the  Mkultra project today is the organized stalking program/remote neural monitoring. It is like a combination of mkultra and cointelpro. Think East German Stazi with advanced mind control, directed energy frequency weapons (havana syndrome type weapons) and surveillance systems. 

This program received a huge boost in funding after 911 and is funded via the terrorist watchlist and unconstitutional secret fisa warrants. It is widely believed that the victims are on the fraudulent terrorist watchlist and money is funneled to keep an eye on the "suspected terrorist." FBI oversees this program with fbi fusion centers, but just the alphabet gang is involved as well. Military (esp airforce and navy), DAARPA, DHS, CIA etc. 

It's estimated that tens of thousands possibly hundreds of US citizens are targeted in this program right now and the numbers grow every year.  I personally believe it's at least in the tens of thousands. This program is also in just about every country other than the poorest. US, Canada, China, Germany, UK, Australia, Russia, etc. Etc. 

Notable whistblowers of this program are Karen Melton Steward NSA, William "Bill" Binney NSA, Ted Gunderson FBI chief, Kirk Wiebe NSA, David Steele CIA, Geral Sosbee FBI chief, Dr. Robert Duncan former CIA contractor, Dr. Erik Kalrstom and Dr. Jon Hall. There are many other Whistblowers including former police, etc.So, you think the exploit/exfiltration catalog being open for all and sundry to wipe their assets with, wasn’t a big thing?

I dunno man.  Snowden tore a big hole in American moral authority and it’s treatment of human rights…"If you're not a terrorist you don't need to worry" is true though. It's just that our police state views everyone as a potential terrorist.No, he pointed out what people were already talking about, but people said it was made up. Their not listening for keywords to start a recording their not saving everyone's data. Sound familiar. What's actually funny how people forgot it already.*The Men Who Stare at Goats* is about certain parts of it.

Technically PROJECT SUN STREAK, but it was a precursor to STAR GATE.It's one of the weird ones, where you end up being unsure how much is serious, or how much is created to distract and confuse.

Like how ESP experiments in the 60s-80s were supposedly BS, designed to make Russia waste money studying the same BS.Yeah I was gonna say. . . are conspiracy theories exclusively American??Tbh, this might be of the funniest things our government has ever done.  Imagine being one of the dudes observing that "experiment", you get home and your wife asks "how was your day at work, babe?"They are programs that were covered up at the time, but I guess that applies to the majority of the military anyway.I’m sick of seeing these lame ChatGPT screenshots everywhere. I’m starting to think people believe that it’s more than just an advanced chat bot. This does *not* belong in a conspiracy subreddit.People in this sub treat random twitter post screenshots as gospel. You’re not dealing with real skeptics here, only people who revel in confirmation bias.What's the definition of a meme?well it basically outputs the mainstream accepted information, and if you know more than they want you too it sometimes gets hard to keep up on what the mainstream matrix claims to be true truthOh neat, I didn’t know Ben wrote a book. I’ve been a long time listener of the STDWTK podcast.This brings into recall a paper written 'On the Viability of Conspiratorial Beliefs'. 

The author takes known, exposed conspiracies and plots the estimated number of people involved in them, against how long they took to be exposed, and then compares that to a bunch of as yet unproven conspiracies, their longevity, and how many people would have to be involved. 

It isn't complementary to any of the 'big' classics, such as moon landing hoaxes or 9/11. Essentially for any of these popular conspiratorial narratives, they would have had exposure or whistleblowers coming forward in a matter of years. 

While it isn't likely to be compelling for anyone invested in these narratives, the article can be found and read for free on PLOS One.When was it proven out side of q belivers?So, you doubt there was a syphilis experiment? Found a shill, everyone.What’s the secret part?

The government experimented on black people, because black people weren’t thought of as actual people back then.

All of this is common knowledge on all sides; the government admits to it and paid damages to those affected.

There’s a difference between “shitty thing” and “conspiracy.”Absolutely wrong. You’re forgetting about the CFR, The “federal” reserve, the fact that congress is bought and paid for. And so much moreYou'd only "solve" US-based conspiracies. The KGB and its successors have more than enough conspiracies themselves, particularly around assasinating political opponents and funding communist terrorists back in the USSR days.For the most part there are wiki articles on each one.Since the news article about lifelog ending was pushed Feb 4 2004, does that mean it ended the same day the article was published?People forgot what Snowden said already, or we wouldn't really have so many nay sayers. That's the sad part.>""If you're not a terrorist you don't need to worry" is true though. It's just that our police state views everyone as a potential terrorist."


That's actually the beauty of mass surveillance it doesn't discriminate.People ignore things that are uncomfortable to think about.

Like we all have mites living on our skin, eating our dead flesh.

Or how likely it is to die in a car accident...

[PROJECT SUN STREAK (BRIEFING)](https://archive.org/details/CIA-RDP96-00789R002100220001-4)


If you're going to just look at one though, I recommend this one, as it has a chronological timeline of a bunch of other related projects and their findings:

[BRIEFING MATERIAL 'A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF PROJECT SUN STREAK'](https://archive.org/details/CIA-RDP96-00789R002100240001-2/mode/2up)

also fascinating slides.None of project startgate is bs. 

Learn how to remote view yourself and you will see. 

Its very easy. I have a link to some good free resources if you want?[They were pretty serious.](https://archive.org/details/CIA-RDP96-00789R002100240001-2/mode/2up) 

[ESP is a real phenomenon, and the government's own documentation suggests that anyone can learn to do it, if they train themselves to it.](https://archive.org/details/CIA-RDP96-00789R003300210001-2/mode/2up) A lot of it gets denied because they were using it for military and intelligence purposes.Ask for the top 911. See what it comes up with.Look into a guy named memoryhold he has a video called pizza for your family. And he is a legit researcher. Had a substack with all the sources and things. Just look into it and see if it adds up at all. I think the q anon stuff was a big push to discredit it.I just dislike when people think AI is some backdoor to learning the secrets of the universe.Same with Fast and Furious, which was just a failed law enforcement operation to track guns. Not sure what the conspiracy was supposed to beI don’t know the specifics. I just know they canceled lifelog when Facebook started. 

I could be wrong.

My other theory with Tesla. If they are tied to the military is they have access to cameras everywhere there is a Tesla. So they can spy anywhere anytime.Yeah, it really is.  The  momentum was extinguished rather rapidly, alas.

However, the material is still out there.  Generations will come back to it.  Hopefully.

And also, there is another factor.  The leaks will continue.Feels like a one way mirror.   


Government spy on everything I do, while hiding information about theirs.   


Give politicians body cams 24/7. I would like to follow them the way they follow meHa, I'm a stoner and vet my day is filled with random thoughts like that to kill time.half of them will be redacted or made-up, but this is a worthy endeavor, lolI agree with you on that one. Goodbye, independent thought.Yeah I was talking with a guy that seriously believed in the "birds are not real" and are robot spies conspiracy (this is even more whacko than flat earthers and I believe both are pushed to discredit real theories)

And I am like "why?" They can listen to every phone, see in every camera, even if you protect yours everyone you walk past, ride with, sit next to at dinner is tracked and listened too. People install them for the government on every laptop, computer, commercial building, new car and even residence doorbells now.

They don't need a fucking robot pigeon to spy on you lol 🤣More like those ring cams. Government can see what's going on at nearly every houseYou really wouldn't not if you wanted to sleep at night lol.>"Give politicians body cams 24/7. I would like to follow them the way they follow me"

It's on them part of me wonders if that's the reason it was a bipartisan effort to pass the Patriot act.

Mass surveillance was already being conducted long before the Patriot act turned it from being a theory to a fact.

Could the establishments that were already conductimg surveillance have had blackmail material on a large portion of the house and Congress at the time to help influence the vote and something that was mostly hidden in the dark and bring it to light while dressing it up as a good thing...

Regardless they're watching everyone.Until they do that, I'm not paying taxes or complying with anything. They can come get me. Either politicians are also subject to the fucked up laws they make, or no one is.Everything makes a lot more sense when you always use the word 'regime' in place of 'government'. This isn't a democracy we're talking about.The big boys have a way to enforce repercussions thoughSam Bankman-Fried, who donated 100M to left wing politicians and scam Americans for billions, is having most of his charges dropped.###[Meta] Sticky Comment

First paragraph.He also donated millions to right wing politicians. Funny how that's always left off huh.He also donated to right wing politicians.  Kinda weird you left that out.[He actually donated about equally to Republicans and Dems](https://time.com/6241262/sam-bankman-fried-political-donations/)

***But his Republican donations were dark money.***

Dark money donations were legalized by the conservatives on SCOTUS, so that the ultra rich can hide how their influencing politics from people like you.

Looks like it worked since you didn't even know about it!He'll serve 4 years at a county club, pay a $5M fine, then move to Belize with the rest of his millions.In what world is 5 out of 13 most?He funneled millions to both Dems and Republicans. They control both sidesHe donated to right wing politicians too.This happens for most rich people regardless of which side of the Uniparty they donate toDemocrats 🙌 Are 🙌 Not 🙌 Left 🙌 Wing 🙌Of course he is. Look at his past, his history, and where he came from. Everyone coming out of MIT has to be treated with great scrutiny. Epstein networks were all through MIT And this kid was part of those networks.

That includes people like lex Friedman who popped up out of nowhere and is recommended literally after every video I watch on YouTube.The scape goat did his job, harvest billions for the crooked ones who lobby against crypto. Steal all the money and run free. Surprise surprise.That’s what happens when you’re rich, doesn’t matter if you’re left or right leaningDidn’t he also donate millions to right wing organizations and political funds? 

Seems kinda one sided to just highlight the left leaning ones…I’m sure his political donations have nothing to do with this. If I stole billions of dollars, I would have the same treatment, right guys??They are moving slower than the speed of science soon all the statues will expire and he will be without legal recourse.Left wing???? Name a single left winger.  Democrats are economic right wingers and at best socially liberal, which is still not left of center.Name one left wing elected politician.  liberals and republicans have the same goals and it includes this guys shitcoin.Poor reading comprehension.

Also FTX donated to both GOP and DNC, his partner did mostly GOP and he did mostly DNC but they had both parties completely covered.So SBF defrauds millions from hard working people - no charges. Donald Trump pays a stripper $181,000 to shut her mouth and he has his life turned upside down. Sounds right 👍>Sam Bankman-Fried [...]

>donated 100M to left wing politicians [...]

>is having most of his charges dropped. [...]

As the should.  He played the game and he's being rewarded.He helped the dems and they are going to help him back. We live in a weird totalitarian type state now. One side gets this, and grandmas on the wrong side get 2 years in prisonNever would have seen this coming lmaoI wonder how the movie is going to play out when we find out the usual suspects pushed him up into the ether to carry on their scam. Ken Griffin of Citadel Securities, Doug Cifu of Virtu, and Steven Cohen of Point72 brought up Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX to create liquidity via swaps in crypto tethers for stonks.Probably because certain people would be exposed. Especially considering it’s election season and the powers that be want another 2020 style selection.Of course.  Israel controls the entire United States and protects their own while torturing and robbing the rest of us, as well as killing plenty more. It's nothing new, just history repeating itself. We are living under some iteration of law based on the Noahide Laws, which are just horrible...and I don't recall getting a vote on that. 

Anyway, we are about to make Weimar Republic 1.0 look like child's play. No one cares and no one wants to do anything to stop it, so we all might as well quit our whining and wait to get exterminated like the Germans.And it’s literally just to get him extradited.He donated a fuck ton to right wing as well
 Watch the coffeezilla break downBeat me to it.  

Holy shit, if only some of these people could read...It’s clearly the deep state thoI consider myself right leaning (more classical liberal/libertarian, so whatever that is), but I do not allow myself to be biased toward those who I typically agree with. We discredit ourselves by giving half-truths like that, it needs to stop completely in all instances. 

All the "sides" are on the same side against we the people anyway.There are a lot of pertinent details OP chose to leave out.Lol, yeah just enough so that people like you could say such meaningless thingaIts not about which party he donated to. Its about what angendas and policies the specific piliticians were pushing. Rich peoples money isnt liberal or conservative.Didn't need the emojis lol but yaMe too...who the hell is Lex Friedman? LolDid you read the article?  Do you think your post is….fake news?You realize the head of the FBI is a Trump appointee right?They are going to add them back in the Bahamas court. Also, 5 of 13 isn't most. Who taught you math?The irony of how terrible yet somehow at same time relevant that attempted false equivalence was is not lost on many of us.Correct me if I’m wrong but he’s already been extradited, is now on house arrest in the US, in his parent house, which was bought with illegitimate FTX funds, while slamming Adderall, mainlining EMSAM, still barely holding down the iron IV rank of league of legends……plz correct my mistakes….Still. Drop for now. Agree to later. Time washes everything away. Later they’ll misplace some evidence or have a more pressing matter and bam. We never hear about it.In what circumstance does it make sense to temporarily drop charges for somebody who blatantly broke the law?He will never be tried. You will forget about it when the next thing happens or the next big football game comes on, and 20 years later you'll be wondering what ever happened with that massive treason he committed against the United States which destroyed the lives of several million people.Let’s get him out of the headlines and maybe people will forget about him

Peoples attentions spans are 5 fucking minutes these days.He was the #2 republican donor in the same cycle, anyone who mentions the democratic donations but not the republican donations is trying to spin a false narrative>coffeezilla 

Can you link me to this alleged breakdown?

All I can find is "Although federal election receipts show that Bankman-Fried donated almost exclusively to Democrats, he claimed on a November phone call with YouTuber Tiffany Fong that he donated an equal amount to Republicans and Democrats.  
“All my Republican donations were dark,” he said, referring to political donations that are not publicly disclosed in FEC filings. “The reason was not for regulatory reasons, it’s because reporters freak the f—k out if you donate to Republicans. They’re all super liberal, and I didn’t want to have that fight.”"

This just sounds to me like he's deflecting from the obviousness of his affiliation with the democratic party. I could say that donated 1 trillion in dark money to the Third Reich, but that doesn't make it true.Well the most obvious part is that he had 13 charges and 5 were dropped (until the Bahamas adjudicates them since they were added after the extradition was approved), so I don't think that's "most".>you say such a meaningless thing40+ million dollars is hardly "just enough"yeah totally not pushing agenda hahahahhahahahhahahhahaha> smooth brain.

Removed - [**Rule 2**](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/wiki/faq)He definitely did not read the article 🤣I would bet good money nothing ever happens to him- if anything does, it's fake and being used as cover. He will never see the inside of anything but a mansion, superyacht, or private jet. When you work for/with the country controlling and destroying the US, of course they won't let you get prosecuted.Those people don't read articles. They just think the way the comments tell 'em to.You’re correct. he’s been extradited but the legality of the extradition is being challenged in court. They’ve basically decided to drop (for now) the charges that were filed post-extradition to push the lawsuit aside, and prevent the issue from holding up the entire trial. Basically: proceed with the charges that aren’t tied to the extradition issue to get the conviction sooner, then revisit the other charges and deal with the extradition lawsuit.and politicians profit. Win win for them both.Lol. He's not getting away with any of this stuff dude.When the perpetrator works for the country that controls and is currently intentionally destroying the US, there should be no expectation of justice. There never will be, don't get your hopes up.When the person breaking the law donated millions to various campaigns.Both parties work for the same people. Anyone who doesn't understand that hasn't been paying enough attention.Thanks. I knew it was a lot didn't want to misspeak"Bankman-Fried contributed more than $70 million to election campaigns in less than 18 months, placing him among the nation’s top political donors. He personally gave at least $40 million to politicians and political action committees ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, mostly to Democrats and liberal-leaning groups, making him the second overall top donor to Democrats, only behind George Soros, according to the Center for Responsive Politics."

All that I see is he was second biggest donor behind Soros to the left. Where are you getting #2 republican donor from? Care to share a link?Yeah surely ‘most’ is at least half 🤣The significant majority of his donations went to one side. Can’t believe that’s a controversial take nowadaysThen why drop the charges at all?He’s the fall guy. He’ll get dragged around courts publicly so people see the government i being hard in bad crypto. He didn’t orchestrate and do the nuggets scheme In a long time if ever all by himself with no one around him realizing.  You think Epstein was a lone wolf and eluded everyone and then conveniently took himself out before naming names? This will be the same. There’ll be no real accountability.No because the "why" part in that article is propaganda. I can figure out the "why" myself, and everyone should or they will never figure out what is actually going on. The entire article is a cover to make people think he'll eventually be tried, but he won't, he's "special" and protected.Israel. Same as Bankman-Fried. Maybe even directly tied to Mossad, but the Israel connection is clear.13 - 5 = 8

8 > 5

Hope this helpsone word can change the entire meaning of a sentence.Is 5 of 13 charges most of the charges?They were added after the Bahamas approved the extradition so the Bahamas wants to allow him to contest them in Bahamian court. Prosecutors offered to drop the contested charges so they could move ahead with the original 8.Ah I see, that sounds promising#neverforget Aaron Swartz was killed because he worked with Alan Greyson and Ron Paul.

What did Aaron Swartz ever have to do with Alan Greyson or Ron Paul? Did he ever say anything about central banking?

This is the same account that [posted](https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/144us5y/if_we_all_know_what_is_going_on_if_reddit_really/) "If we all know what is going on, if reddit really kills Aaron Swartz to help Maxwellhill, if reddit changes API to help Isabel to steal data, then why not change platform? There are sites that have nft blog. Your conspiracy prediction is right? Your nft value increases."

What?  NFTs? Maxwellhill? 

Who is upvoting these word salad posts?This just jumped from 261-461 while I read top comment? Bots are activeMIT are a bunch of shameless rats for this.Never forget that Aaron took the info from MIT, where Epstein & friends were working..

I’m sure he found more than we know of[The Internet's Own Boy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vz06QO3UkQ)SS: Even a young adult Aaron Swartz was better than anybody in Reddit in terms of software architecture. 

Reddit's Alex Ohanian hates him, but loves Maxwellhill. Every time Swartz is mentioned Ohanian/Spez and others have cringe expression like you mentioned the name of an insect.

This is because Reddit wanted to sell the data to Mossad. But right now the market is down and Reddit may face congressional hearing, so Ohanian and Huffman just want IPO fast before things get out of hand.

Aaron Swartz was eliminated and his legacy was destroyed. Swartz wanted to create a movement. Federal Reserve can't have that. Presiden'ts secret service was spying on Swartz

Representative Greyson and Paul asked Ben Bernaki couple of times 'how do you feel about an audit of the federal reserve'? Fed chair said an audit will send a message through the aether and market will panic'

&#x200B;

Abolish the federal reserve.. Nationalize SmithsonianHe wasn't really the co-founder of Reddit. He founded Origami and Reddit merged with them.This comment section reads like bots arguing with other bots…and not very well, might I addAlways follow the money, it always leads back to that little place.Abolishing patents is stupid. They certainly have issues but at worst it delays progression by 20-25 year. Not having patent protection results in things being kept a trade secret which means nobody will benefit from it if it just gets shelved or the company goes tits up. 

Practical example; I have patents in my name, but some things we decided to not patent because it is too easy for others to run with it and hide that they are doing it. For one of these secret things the project was placed on hold and the idea/technology has been rotting on a shelf for the past 5 years, probably forever. One key person has already moved on to do other things. Had we patented it academics could already play with it, and commercialisation would be possible in 20 years. 

Practical example 2: friend of mine has a company and for one of the products he knows the Chinese would just copy it if he filed for a patent. So just he and his friend know how the product they make is made. Both are in their 60's now so if they don't sell it when retiring it'll be lost to time until someone else comes up with this ideaEvery American should be grateful to Ron Paul. He gave us President Clinton, 99 cent gas, and a budget surplus! Right wingers, please split your vote again and always.

Who is up voting this?  


have bots completely taken over reddit? because this makes it look like that>Who is upvoting these word salad posts?

Bots, it feels like 50% of Reddit posts/comments are bots now.Aaron Swartz was going to provide open access to all academic journals. He was arrested after downloading huge caches of such documents.

Which is interesting, because Robert Maxwell, was the one who turned scientific journals into a spectacular money-making machine that bankrolled his rise in British society.

The strong suspicion that Ghislane Maxwell, Robert Maxwell’s daughter and helper to notorious pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, was a “supermod” on this site is super coincidental.IPO on reddit was when valuation was 15 billion, that happened about 2 years ago 2020 some other stuff happened in that year and the next year some more things happened and a lot of media big media companies tanked. That might be why there is no IPO, there was no IPO, could be why they would want to rush to an IPO not sure don't know what half the stuff you said was.

Each user has a allowed network of other users that can see their content, and this list is usually updated randomly so that they are kept unknowing that not everyone see's everything on the site. The term shadowban is similar to this process but it is not as direct because the content can always be direct linked, but does not mean it will show up with searches or in the latest tab.Until you bring your idea to market, you should have no patent claim.He downloaded the research archive of the MIT library which was behind a paywall and only available to enrolled students and subscribers, and was making it available publicly online for FREE because he believed that knowledge should be free. The feds at the behest of the administration at MIT arrested him under several charges and were going to put him in prison for the rest of his life.

He buckled under the pressure and ended his fight by taking his own life according to the popularly believed narrative which I believe to be 100% correct and true. There were many friends and family members who were in contact with him during his last weeks and months who spoke of his ongoing struggle with hopelessness and depression and sadness and his belief that his life was over.

Using him as a political pawn for the GOP agenda and the far right is kind of disgusting IMO

I hope this post gets taken down, it has no basis in fact.[His prosecution was absolutely politically motivated.](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/16/ortiz-heymann-swartz-accountability-abuse)it's only gonna get worse wiþ þese new changeshttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Internet_theoryWith the merger, they agreed to give him the title of co-founder but he had nothing to do with the Reddit as a website.From the first linked article,

> Swartz's Web savvy took him from Internet entrepreneur to online activist, co-founding Demand Progress, a group that campaigns for progressive public policy — in particular fighting against Internet censorship.

Funny how freedom of speech was considered a "progressive public policy" ten years ago, but today the progressive agenda aims to shut down every avenue of free speech to allegedly "protect minorities".I meant it as a joke but your comment made me realize that this might actually happen. A wonder tbh.Interesting. I could see reddit doing that, but what is the evidence of this?Agreed. 5 years to prepare your launch, 20 years of protection. If you don't launch in those 5 years your patent should become public property. 

And I'm saying that while one of my patents would have expired under those conditions

It would force people to actually take action and to push innovation instead of just sitting on itI don't 

Depression and suicidal ideation is roughThis sub still believes AntiFa did 1/6.Pretty much all popular forces that attempt to implement positive change with a chance of success eventually either get co-opted or destroyed. Aaron was just one tragic example."free speech" doesn't really include hate speech which is what most conservatives often say.  it's funny how some people like to spin up their own definitions for words & then pronounce it like it's true.       

btw - have always found Swartz's death a bit fishy, but supposedly he was a "depressive" - but it always seemed a bit too quick.  whatever, RIPI explained it was a joke in the other comment so no evidence. It does sound like something that could happen ( censorship on reddit ) but once again no evidence and I could be wrong.You know it's funny, back in 2020 I did a deep dive on the domain antifa.com...  most people are aware that it used to be a anti facist website associated with the European anarchist movement back in the '90s and it went dormant for many years. It was purchased about 6 or 9 months BEFORE the BLM riots And existed as an empty page with nothing on it until 2 DAYS AFTER the first time Trump said antifa on television. Then it SUDDENLY sprang to life with the Charlie Chaplin dressed as Hitler video which remains there until Biden won the election and its functioned as a redirect to Whitehouse.gov ever since. People on the news and all over the internet were talking about how it was antifa's homepage when it's so painfully obvious that it was purchased by one of Trump's cronies MONTHS ahead of the BLM riots in preparation for his creation of this "domestic terrorist" organization that didn't exist until he gave it a name.

Unfortunately due to "private registration" I don't know who it is who bought the domain and kept it dormant untill the day after Trump invented Antifa, Nothing short of a subpoena will get those records. But they absolutely exist that much is for certain. It doesn't really matter, nobody really WANTS to know the TRUTH... All they want are CONVENIENT LIES that support the narrative they've already come to believe. And the website was bought and paid for months before the beginning of 2020 specifically for that purpose.

I really don't like this timeline.

I just noticed how it was being forced down people's throats via fear mongering and as usual I thought to myself:

"Fuck the state."Lol. Antivaxxers use Twitter screenshots from Catturd as evidence of facts. Tells you all you need to know.how many times are we gonna see this same discussion? those who never got the vax desperately wanna be put on a throne. btw im against the vax and all that covid BS they put us through but omg no one’s gonna worship those who never got it. half of you are killing yoursef in other ways anyways so chillSs

Every medical expert who actually reviewed the signs agreed that coronavirus wasn't dangerous with a 98.9% survival rate

And all of the top experts including one of the founders of MRNA technology agreed that the vaccine not only wasn't effective but even according to top Pfizer executives and researchers wasn't even necessary for most people if they had already gotten and recovered from the disease..

The only people claiming otherwise were paid celebrity spokespeople late night comedy show hosts and politicians Like Joe Biden and that anti science nutjob Anthony Fauci who were taking money from pharmaceutical companies.Let’s tell that to the families that lost family members!The medical community will never admit it, but Catturd is right!Free unvaccinated sperm for qualified women (actual women with vagina and uterus not 2020s mentally ill dudes)\>Early 2000s: SARS only kills a few thousand people in China from bad living conditions. Hydroxychloroquine or Ivermectin usually knocks it out...

\>September 2019: ***Bootleg vape cartridges*** are producing ***respiratory distress*** in users in Western countries...

\>December 2019: There has been a SARS outbreak in China.

\>January 2020: It's not a big deal. It only kills old and fat people, and then the virus disappears into the "common cold" within a few months...

\>February 2020: It's racist to say SARS came from Chinese people. Pelosi and Schumer block "travel bans" and encourage Americans to HUG PEOPLE in Chinatown.

\>February 2020: Don't bother with Surgical Bibs, only N95 masks prevent SARS transmission. Just wash your hands and don't touch your face.

\>March 2020: *Oh shit, we might immediately run out of N95 masks* even though they are easily manufactured by several megalithic companies who have the resources to immediately mobilize participation in a "global pandemic" ASAP.

April 2020: Literally everybody in Western Civilization has to wear a cloth mask. All businesses must shut down or face fines. All of the old people must be confined to their quarters, and all of the fat sick people have to get their lungs blown out on respirators.

\>May 2020: Look at all the old and fat people dying. Look at how many businesses are closed. You can't even go out anymore... ***THIS IS SERIOUS!***I did the exact same. I was going to get it, then I got Covid and it wasn’t bad. Had to wait 60 days before I could get a dose because that was the rule then. Then within those 60 days everyone went crazy and started talking about putting people who refuse vaccines in camps and/or fining them. Then that bullshit Herman Cain sub Reddit came out.

I realized that all the people who were pushing this agenda and the vaccine were the people I couldn’t care less about.

I refused to get it from that point forward. 2 years later I am so happy I held my ground on it.

There’s still crazy vaxxers out there, but if you notice, everyday they’re getting a little more quiet. 

Their new response is “Covid has been over why are we still talking about it”. LolThis.

I saw the force and said fuck off.

I was later justified by "the science".Lol drug addicts Don't even have Twitter screenshots. The science disagrees with you druggies98.9% is taking all age ranges into consideration. Most of the deaths were like in the 60-80 year old range I believe. I did the math and I believe there was about a 1/11,000 chance someone in the 18-29 year old range would die of Covid early on, and most of them were probably very overweight and/or had multiple comorbidities.That isn’t a great survival rate for a virus, and isn’t uniform across all age groups.
1 in 500 people that had Covid in the US died, that’s a pretty shitty result.If you can find them. They don't exist. There's absolutely zero evidence that anybody died of coronavirus.

I know some peak list created by far left intelligence agencies doesn't count.Actually the medical community does admit that. The only people pretending that he's wrong are late night comedy host and far left pundits on the payroll of the DNC"If you're good at something never do it for free"


-jokerThey realized how much power they could gain from it and how much money they could gain from it. So unlike the swine flu which was more deadly and unlike monkey pox which was basically the same thing they had a three-fold trifecta. Making money. Increasing government power. And helping to enact regime change against the sitting Republican president

There was virtually no downsides for them knowing how stupid the average American and European isDon't forget the winter of death tweeted out by the white house' official account

The entire situation was fake and was used to print(steal) trillions and trillions of dollars, euro, yen, pounds and yuan.

Fuck the state. May they all rot in hell.Lol. It doesn't but I am glad catturd can make you feel smarter. :)And if you look at that demographic they're also the same ones who could be extremely hurt just from getting pneumonia or any other disease. It wasn't specific to COVID

For the majority of people and the majority of people affected by the lockdowns It was the safest thing ever. Safer than the common cold..

It was all a giant cash grab and power move. The pharmaceutical companies made trillions and the government got to increase its power and surveillance massively in a way that they would never have to give upIt's actually a pretty good rate. It was the same with SARS

Same with swine flu and the things that happened into Obama and the world wasn't shut down. But then again it didn't happen during an election year where they were trying to regime change the sitting Republican president

Same reason that monkey pox basically fizzled out and nobody freaked out about it. It was the same thing with the same stats but there wasn't a sitting Republican president for the CIA to enact a color revolution regime change on..

And age groups? Yes you're right. Among the under 50 crowd it was virtually non-existent in terms of danger. And for school age kids they were absolutely zero deaths. It was less problematic than the common cold

The ONLY people that it actually potentially had an effect on was severely medically compromised and extremely elderly. AKA the same kind of old people who could be killed from catching pneumonia or any other disease..

So it was actually way higher than 98.9%. It had 100% survivability for almost every person that caught it except extremely specific and vulnerable demographics..

Particularly demographics that you wouldn't find in the workforce and therefore there was no reason to shut down the entire world rather than just putting them in safe places until it blew over..

Then again they don't care about that either. Because they were putting COVID patients in nursing homes with the more vulnerable elderly instead of on the medical cruise ships that Donald Trump sent to New York.. So they didn't really care about protecting people either

And for a glimpse at what the people in charge of COVID thought of it All you have to do is look at all the lavish unmasked parties they had all throughout COVID not worrying a damn bit about the disease that they knew they made up

Obama's birthday filled with tons of celebrities all unmasked. Hollywood award shows where all the rich celebrities showed up on masked but all of the servers and caterers had to be masked up

That funeral for that fentanyl abusing life-beating George Floyd where they were all packed in like sardines for some politically motivated bullshit funeral

And of course promoting and endorsing the extremely crowded and pack BLM riots..

So it's not like the elites who made it up we're worried about it. Pretty much because they knew they made it up and the COVID wasn't a thing

People like you were certainly running around like chickens with their heads cut off thinking that the world was coming to an end and you were living through the zombie apocalypse. Proof of how easy it would be to control you. And they learn that lesson. They know they can control you quite easilyMy uncle died. Guess I'll let everyone know he wasn't real.You’re FOS. My Dr lost her mother and father 6 months apart. My daughter is an RN and my son-in-law is a Dr. They worked their asses off through Covid and watched people die alone from COVID. You’re comment is just an uneducated and stupid one.Until they start paying out billions in lawsuits and acknowledging the fraud, I won't agree. This was a well coordinated scam supported by many people.The same white house that told the public via the President that if we got the shot we wouldn’t get sick? 

I completely agree with you.He didn't die from coronavirus that's for sure. According to CDC studies nobody died from coronavirus. Other causes maybe but not coronavirusWhat age? what Pre-existing illness? How long did he stay in the hospital? …?Yeah I'm calling bullshit. Even people with the same disease don't tend to die 6 minutes apart. And there certainly no evidence that anybody died from coronavirus. Even if they did die it wasn't from coronavirus. But I'm calling bullshit on your story because liberals make up stories on a regular basisThe people in power are not the medical community.. The medical community was silenced by the people in power.. And the people in power were the ones protecting them from lawsuitsYep, that same white house.

The same white house that said the first step to hurricane preparedness was to "get vaccinated now".I'm sorry you don't understand how comorbidities work.None of your business. None of your business. None of your business.I know better than to try and talk to conspiracy Magats. I’ll pray for you. 🤦🏼‍♀️wow i’m 100% against the vax and all that covid BS but to deny that anyone actually died of covid you gotta really have your tinfoil hat on too tight around your headRegardless, they were complicit. That doesn't excuse them for not using their own knowledge, protecting patients, and bending under pressure. This caused potentially millions of deaths and untold and unknown medical problems due to mRNA damage.

Every person that advocated for that and especially people who poked others with that, and especially ones who threatened and shamed ones who didn't want it should answer in part, as well as the corrupt people who pushed the scam!The vaccine stops hurricanes.  That's a fact, jack.Lol I’m getting downvoted and losing my imaginary internet points for saying what I said. Notice how they won’t respond to anything.They won't respond because it's bot farms and they're just mass down voting from faith accounts using software.

There's nobody like an actual person actually behind any of those accounts so there's nobody to comment anythingCan you just imagine if the queen wasn't vaccinated? It would have been so much worseTotally not a depopulation agenda though, right? Right?###[Meta] Sticky Comment

"Bro, you ain't even eco-friendly"WE  should give up cars, food now kids but their  learjets sre sacred how can anyone still  fall for this hot airNah. I'm going to keep having kids. Fuck these people. 

Birth rates are a real issue. Over population is propaganda. They don't want too many peasants to have babies. The more peasants, the more chance they will come together to destroy them at some point.But in UK we are told we need immigration to cover the gaps created by reducing birth rates...I really bet they’re pushing this in countries that actually have fertility rates above replacement.. /sOnly depopulation for those with European genetics.When every single member of the WEF and John Kerry gives up private jets and cars then moves to the woods in a lil log cabin and washes their clothes in the water they raise from a well in a bucket and live like Timon and Pumba flipping logs for grubs then maybe I’ll consider eating cicadas again.

-Also, when they do that, please tell them to take that poor lil mentally challenged kid with fetal alcohol syndrome with them. What was her name…Greta something or another.Leftist logic never fails to get a facepalm.Is this a way of manufacturing consent for synthetic surrogates? And also ignoring the mounting evidence that forever chemicals and other endocrine disruptors are diminishing reproductive health on a global scale. In not just humanity but in the natural world too. 

Along with the proposal of corporations purchasing homes on a mass scale. Would childless families of the future be encouraged to be surrogate parents to the corps synthetic workforce? There is film out there called 'vivarium' https://m.imdb.com/title/tt8368406/
which in its own way touches on this subject.

Imagine living in one of these houses that are connected to the internet of things. Surveiled 24/7 sharing a home with a voyeurist synth who relies on constant human interaction to improve its syntax and linguistics.This is the only time you are allowed to see a picture of an all white family.Propagandistic piece.

First of all, the writer is all over the place as if they had to squeeze in a list of designated talking points.  The writer also goes from suggesting "one less baby" would cut down on 58.6 CO2 tonnes emissions.  But then you scan the chart on the right hand side and it states, "not having babies [reduces CO2 emissions by 58.6 tonnes]"

Now sure, I get it, perhaps it's an issue with the way things are being worded here.  But I'm sorry, not sorry, nothing inconspicuous about this blatant eugenics propaganda.

Of course we can't possibly do away with burning fossil fuels, right?Edit: It’s an op ed btw. 

So there’s a study suggesting that having babies is producing 58.6 times CO2 and parents should consider to counter balance the CO2 and having one child less. 

(Edit: there are more than 10 countries with fertility rates over 5 and 54 countries with rates over 3)

If the study is right, where’s the problem? Should science be silenced just because some conspiracy theorists don’t like the outcome of this study?SS: Apparently not having babies is 20x to 60x better for the environment than anything else you can do.  But this is totally unrelated to the eugenics the billionaires have been caught studying and promoting over several decades, just a weird coincidence it completely satisfies that goal as well.People believing co2 is the problem still 🙄🤣Was in a st paddy’s day parade this year and saw a couple of protesters with signs that read “having children is selfish” and so on.They should replace kids with old people. Seniors over 70. See how that works outMy latest idea is we give people that choose to not have kids the socialist paradise of their dreams as a trade for helping out the planet. No take backs either. Genes officially eliminated.Wait until they discover the dangers of depopulationhttps://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/having-children-one-most-destructive-172127595.html

She dared to put a black kid in an article about not having kids.


https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caroline_Mortimer
As one of the top 1%, she is probably responsible for more ecological damage than all your kids combined.Reminds me of the clip from the amazing show Utopia

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mn3oXHSUdKYWhat about just fiscal policy? It’s not the ‘science nuts’ or the gays making us young people not want kids. It’s the fact that we can afford it. Not just the raising the kid but birthing it!Surprised changing light bulbs isn’t eating bugs or committing suicide.Anytime someone blasts me for being "anti vax" I just tell them they hate the planet and don't do enough to stop global warming because people dying of COVID stops pollution.

I'm actually only half joking 😀Reminds me of Doug Stanhope's anti-kid bits.It should be. Why does this bother you?Yeah, the writer who submitted this was handled by one of the world's overlords who coerced or bribed him/her into writing this and convincing everyone to think of Mother Nature before having unprotected sex.  Sounds plausibleAs someone who looks at satellite data and logistics ~~ The worlds population SHOULD be worried about raw/core resources. 

Whats telling is every country is trying to reduce demand* vs increasing supply. The world has reached its limits in many sectors. Look at the Great Lakes in North America and the fish populations YoY past 100 years.It's a gentle depop agenda but as for the hard-core version I'm sure they thunk it.Because every time I have to go through NYC I'm just thinking "man, we sure need more people"I once saw this terribly horrific German commercial where a skinny German fellow who has been in several U.S. movies as an exra-like bad guy in action movies approached a woman on a train platform and called her child a "filthy little thing" and proceeded to taunt and snicker at the woman noting that the world would be a better place if someone smothered the child. 

I want to say I saw it around 2021 on this board somewhere but can't find it for the life of me. When I saw it, I thought to myself, "well it was a matter of time" but didn't expect we would be here already. Tragically, since then, there are now tens of thousands of proud millennial and gen-z kids declaring that procreation of the human species is environmentally irresponsible and reckless. There's even a name for it now? Which I forget...

Been trying to find that video again. Even anyone has it, please post!the real conspiracy is all the breeding propaganda in the media so you keep churning out wage slaves. making u think there is a depopulation agenda to inspire you to have more as well. sad thing is Idiocracy is actually playing out. never in my life have I felt like I’m surrounded by more stupid people.Sick people,will be alone in their deathbeds…They're not even cute tbf....no little groin goblins for me thanksTrust me, the government doesn’t want less kids, they want more. It is the only way this whole pyramid scheme works.I am 1000% for there being less peopleThere's a housing crisis, you guys want less immigration but at the same time... you want people to have more kids? Make up your fucking mind.To be fair, it's better than depopulation through genocide. It's not like the planet can sustain constant population growth 🤷‍♂️I could write an opinion piece advocating for the eradication of snakes. Doesn’t mean there is a global conspiracy.To be fair, one can avoid having kids without killing them before they’re born. The article isn’t arguing in favor of abortion."hey Steve, you want to see your new naphew ? Here, do you want to hold it?"

"eeew, take it away, do you know those things aren't even eco friendly, right?"Specific demo in mind for this article eh?Yes, childfree styles and abortions for some, and mass immigration for others.  I wonder what the difference is between these 2 groups here?Woah, just ignoring the sourced study by Lund University that provides all the details huh?That seems to be the major push these days, silence any scientific study that disagrees with conservative thought.One less child? What was the base number of children in the study?It's not on an op-ed page. It's on the trends page.

Is this actually science though?Fr like bro plants *literally* need it to survive. We put it out, they “eat” it and turn it into oxygen.That involves politicians that have more sex scandals than votes per county.The study is probably not even wrong and suggests that new parents could counter balance the carbon footprint of giving birth. 
Just because a scientific study is correct does not mean that a global depopulation strategy has been enacted.Covid would suggest otherwise...>Is this actually science though?

YES IT IS*Plants hate this one weird trick*>that new parents could counter balance the carbon footprint of giving birth.
 
Literally not even when the article or study is about. It clearly states its about **not giving birth**
 
Holy gaslighting, batman.Sure it is.  Its based on cow farts, now baby fartsJust checked and the study apparently says “one less child” and not “not giving birth”. 
& looking at fertility rates over 5 in 10 countries and fertility rates over 3 in 54 countries that’s maybe!! not even a bad decision.Use your brain for 3 seconds and think of how much of a carbon footprint your existence and consumption creates. 

Think of ALL the energy cost it has taken for your entire life to heat your home, power your car, give you an electric grid, to produce everything you've ever purchased, to pump water to your house etc.

Making more people is an environmental problem so stop pretending science doesn't exist.US offers to drop some charges for now against Sam Bankman-Fried. What sort of privilege is it when you can steal billions and escape accountability?###[Meta] Sticky Comment

It's a scam and the big networks (surveilled and tracked BTC and ETH) are captured by WEF/Rotschild for a long time and now officially through BlackRock.

How does that benefit you? Just go to synagogue. You’ll find plenty of sweetheart jobs that the average POC would never have access to. It’s actually pretty pathetic and a waste of networking if you’re Jewish and not with some sort of connection to a sweetheart job.Oof, what do you think led to the kristallnacht?? The jews raised interest rates and food (hence- bread lines) which led the German to retaliate. There was a conference of Jewish business men back in the 1930s the declared war on Germany and crippling their economy way before WWII.

The central bank in Germany, the Reichsbank, was essentially ran by the Nazi party well before kristallnacht. The president of the Reichsbank at the time was not Jewish and literally supported the Nazi party in all but name (heck, he even raised money for Hitler). The trigger for kristallnacht was the assassination of Ernst Vom Rath. The Nuremberg laws came into effect in 1935, 3 years before kristallnacht. You’re literally peddling straight Nazi propaganda.

Germany’s economy was crippled by, inter alia, war reparations from WWI, creating a perfect environment for nationalist movements to use minorities as a scapegoat.Get on J swipe my man. Go to chabat.

Sounds more to me like the problem is having your steering, braking, and acceleration able to be controlled wirelessly. OTA updates, I can see being a benefit. But, to control throttle/brakes/steering should require a physical connection to the OBD-II port via a cable

Modern cars are a mess. Car companies are more interested in turning them into rolling smart phones than they are building regular cars. BMW is putting selfie cams in their new EV models. Why?One reason I refuse to give up my 1980’s wrangler and refuse to buy any cars that I cannot fix myself or know how to fix

Side note if you keep older cars, visit junkyards and accumulate commonly broken parts for the car.How difficult is it to plug into an ODB2 port? I really don't see a need for over-the-air updates. We recently saw tens of millions of cars get recalled for faulty airbags and some how this labor-intensive fix was manageable.News flash…if you know how to fix a car you can do whatever the hell you want to your car.Right to repair is far more important then "kill switches". If something is yours, you should be able to fix it. Without some software saying you can't. Like if you try to replace parts in newer phones the parts may not register or function because you are not a certified technician.   
It is important for:   
Farming equipment.   
Phones.  
Cars.   
Printers/Scanners.   
Pretty much most techIn a nutshell? Yes.

Your car needs permission from the internet to start. It can be queried for GPS position at any time. There is a camera in the dashboard aimed at your face and a microphone overhead that hears every word ever uttered in your car. The car is capable of sending data packets out to the internet as you drive (and does). In the event that the internet, in its sole and unquestionable opinion, determines that your car has  strayed too far abroad or broken any other arbitrary rule it can be killed outright, put in "recovery mode" which basically means top speed = 20 mph, or if it is a Tesla it can just drive itself back to the dealership and turn itself in.

The excuse for implementing the law where ALL cars must behave like this will be climate or carbon footprint, but the infrastructure is already there. That will be right around the time they also ban gas cars so there goes trying to drive a 76 Chevy.

Personally, I took a look around the parking lot at my apartment and I noticed that the number of electric cares appears to be zero. I personally have NO plans to throw down upwards of 50K to get myself one because that is way outside my budget. I strongly suspect that most of my neighbors feel exactly the same way.

So, when they ban gas cars and/or take all the parking spaces for "carbon friendly" vehicles, that doesn't mean me and it doesn't mean any of my neighbors. So I wonder who they will be for?It’s about the manufacturers making more money.  If you cannot repair anything more than an oil change in your own garage, so you take the vehicle to an authorized mechanic.  Oh, and the vehicles are so complex that even certified mechanics may not have the training so you are forced to return to the dealer for repairs.I wonder who the NHTSA are funded by.Simpler.  The longer the chassis, drivetrain, engine last, the fewer cars are sold.

Money is in repairs.  $600 door handles, $2500 bumpers. $1500 circuit board for check engine light.  Higher profit margins than cars. It's like printers, they could damn near give them away (except for the UAW pensions they need to pay).Everyone switching to the John Deere business model…Farmers aside... Why would you purchase a vehicle that requires a User Agreement? 

**Get your motorcycle license immediately...**There's been times were I've talked about cars being hackable now only to to be received by the typical "yeah, yeah, sure". This is another reason they keep pushing EV's imo. They'll be able to limit our usage and destinations.So these kill switches that are placed are not removed or talked about by the dozens or dozens of people who would have access to this information, but Bob, with his ASC cert, GED, and zero programing knowledge, down at your local repair shop would be able to find and remove this kill switch that only he knows about?Lack of knowledge to lack of interest. A lot of folks do not have the knowledge to carry out DIY repairs on their cars, while some folks do not want to deal with the hassle.Its like the iphone. They want you to buy another one next year when the shitty parts they intentionally use break.Its really more about greed and planned obselscense. The manufactures dont want to sell you parts anymore. They want to sell you a whole new vehicle.lol vehicles have been able to be remotely shutdown for years, do you live under a rock?>rolling smart phones

I hate modern cars so much because of this. Why on earth can a steering wheel be hacked? It's a simple mechanical solution. This is why I drive 15 yo+ vehicles.Michael Hastings is alleged to have been murdered after his car was hacked.Probably to detect if the driver is not looking at the road (e.g. falling asleep, looking at their phone).They're also charging a subscription fee to use stuff on the new BMWs.... just something to note.Yes.   We have cars that are 90s (I have a car husband ) and we have One normal (2017) car.

No one can fix our older cars.  We have cars littered in the side yard.. at least no one can see this shame.

But yeah my MIL and my husb and my other old car ..  never pass  emissions anymore.  Break down after getting fixed.  Everything is is about get a new catalytic converter.How about OnStar? Satellite hookup between GM vehicles and GM. If they can talk to the computer to unlock your doors they can control the vehicle.If im a manufacturer and I made a mistake in the software of a safety system control unit such as stability control or something related to emissions, do I send out notices to customers that may or may not have the vehicle in their possession anymore or may or may not even care enough to being their car to the dealer to have it programmed, or do I just force an OTA update and guarantee the fix is done without ever having to get the car into a shop?

I got a notice recently of a recall for an old bmw I sold 2 years ago. I bet the new owner would love to see that notice but who knows who or where the new owner is. OTA is the way.Exactly, I fix my own shit, who says I can't?Interesting do you have sources on the new cars having cameras and controlled and all that? I'm forced to rent a newer car (jetta 2021) because my old one got totaled, which I'm sure is all part of uber's plan along with profiling all who use it. 
Haven't noticed these cameras but the 'infortainment system' is always needing 'upgrades' and I'm not sure how far that stretches.

Also they did away with the aux cable its all bluetooth now >:(Self driving car can lock you in and take you where they want. I don't like it one bit.The electronic management systems of a modern car aren't inherent to an EV. Every single new car has a massive amount of electronics, and a kill switch would be easy as piss to hide in one regardless of power train weather its gas, diesel or electric.Future Pandemic 2048! Mandatory over the air limitations on all vehicles, no more driving than 10 miles from 'home' and only with initial trip permission and approved reason (like getting the vax!) from government AI.Pull the fuse to the telematics module, onstar module, or whatever the manufacturer calls their modem or disconnect it completely. It doesn't exactly take a rocket scientist to disable wireless communications in these cars"Right to repair" laws apply to third party mechanics as well. If they strip away independent mechanics ability to access service info, that makes your only repair option the dealer. 

Even if you have 0 desire to work on your own car, right to repair still affects youNo, I've been aware. I made the post because even though what you say is true articles like these have been popping up more frequently and are usually associated with the 2030 agenda.>Why on earth can a steering wheel be hacked?

Right?!?

The newest car I've ever owned is my current daily, sitting at 12 years old. I got it because it had an extended factory warranty (dieselgate) and apparently VW doesn't know how to work on their own cars. Usually I do all my own work, but when it stalled and left me stranded on the side of the road I had it towed to VW. They had it for four freaking months, and said it was "fixed."

They were kinda right, it didn't stall, but when I got out on the highway and hit 65mph it went into limp mode. Long story short, after I called that dealer and told them what I think about their "technicians", I spent several weeks diagnosing the thing. Jeez, what a pain, even as old as that thing was, it was still an over-complicated German POS. Plus, all of VW's wiring diagrams are labeled in German, so black = sw, red = rt, etc.. Just to make it all a little more irritating I guessTbh buying used is way better anyway. Nobody needs a brand new car. Just blind consumerismBecause they use electric steering motors instead of hydraulic which in reduces fuel consumption. The bad part is they are controlled via the computer . There is obviously still a manual steering shaft going to the steering rack though.Yeah, but if SHTF emissions no longer matter.>No one can fix our older cars.

No way, you just gotta find the right mechanic. Cars from the 90s are dirt simple to work on. The older the car, the easier it is to work on

If you're emissions testing cars older than '96 and all they do is plug in the scan tool. An O2 sensor spacer/defouler will trick the car into thinking the cat is good and trick the tester as wellExactly, so why would I want to buy a car with OnStar? Most modern cars take an effort to lock yourself out.Yes, but you must remember that your scenario only covers software. Most recalls are due to mechanical failures or defects. Of course, it's easier for the manufacturer but that also has consequences. 

Speaking of BMWs and software, their traction control will get you killed. Nothing like pulling into traffic and having a little wheel spin and the car slams on the brakes. I hated mine.>force an OTA update

They can't force OTA updates remotely. The consumer has to download and start the update. 

Manufacturers are taking the "EA" approach and releasing half-baked software that requires constant security updates and tweaks. If it weren't the wireless connectivity itself, most of the updates wouldn't be necessary. Most of them are either security upgrades or meaningless junk that doesn't affect how the car drivesAgreed. The only complexity is complexity actually. The days of soaking a carburetor in a acetone are long gone. But if you can fix it you should!I rode in a Tesla that seemed to have a mind of its own and was capable of autonomous operation. So, if there is a "manual" mode and the car actually respects it, no problem. But this car seemed to want to make its own moves. I saw the driver have to take control back from the car and it was a little unnerving. And yes, there was a camera and mic in there because you could facetime while you drive and so forth. A Tesla is every bit the internet appliance as a iPhone.I think it’s weird that our cars didn’t pass emissions for the first time ever this year which meant taking them in for week long mechanical check ups.Please tell me now about how someone can do this, and the effort required.Right. I was specifically responding to the OTA subject. Mechanical defects would obviously need human (or robotic 😳) intervention.Half baked software you say (correctly)? Welcome to reasons A through about Z why I don't want my car steering itself or even worse overriding my inputs.For the O2 sensor spacers?

All you need is the spacer itself, which is like $10. Then you just unbolt the rear O2 sensor, screw the spacer into the hole it came out of, and screw the O2 sensor into the spacer. Depending on the car, you might have two rear O2 sensors

The hardest part is getting the O2 sensor out. But if you get a big old breaker bar and an O2 sensor socket plus some PB Blaster, its not too bad.Thank you.

If this is all its affecting then maybe you should be blaming something other than the vaccine considering they get used around the worldI’m one of them. It fucking sucksBuddies wife got a pacemaker. My aunt had a stroke and went blind in her right eye. 🤷‍♂️ 

We said it was probably a bad idea but hey at least they didn’t catch a glorified cold bug! (Edit) they all still caught it anyway.Always be wary of anything they’re scaring you to take.Update! I'm vaxxed and boosted. My dick still hasn't fallen off or exploded like so many anti-vaxxers predicted. It's been a couple years now? Still waiting.What to do to make it better? Definitely feel something is up, constant chest pains, never had any type of pain in my chest before vaccination. I'm pretty young and healthy.Im not surprised it, I always though of it as a "russian roulette"The concerns raised by Dr. Thomas Levy regarding potential heart damage caused by Covid vaccines highlight the need for further research and evaluation.Wonder if they worked with the vaccines cause autism fools.It is scary if the COVID vaccine causes severe heart damage, because the vaccine is strong, so it can be harmful to human health.My early 30s sister who was completely healthy before the shot had a heart attack 2 weeks after her second Covid dose. She ended up in the icu like 4 months later because her heart rate was at 190 and the emergency room people couldn’t get it to go down. she is now on 3 heart medicines for the rest of her life and no one can tell her why.There's a lot of businesses here in the UK that have jars rasing funds for defibrillators. Train stations have now installed defibs, too. Never seen as many of them before the vaccineYou know what's dumb about that statement? Way more than 100 million people have taken these injections. So that means potentially billions of people have the same heart damage. And I'm going to tell you what's actually in these vials. Several doctors have found living cells in these so-called "vaccines". And guess what these cells appear to be doing? They appear to be producing peptides. But not just any peptides, it appears to be venom peptides from several different animals (both terrestrial and aquatic). 

Scientists have been able to create living cells outside of animals that produce venom for years now. That would explain the blood clots, the neurological damage, the myocarditis, the pericarditis, and of course death. Those are all symptoms of invenomation. I strongly, strongly urge everyone alive to watch the presentation Covenom-19 on Rumble. These living cells will keep producing these peptides at room temperature aka inside of the body. The only thing known to be able to counteract it is high dose vitamin C, vitamin D3, and believe it or not, nicotine. Nicotine can inhibit the effects of several different venoms and toxins. Many of these peptides (especially the conotoxins produced by cone snails) attach to the nicotinic receptors and nicotine can block their effects.A friend's son was born with a small hole in his heart. It healed itself eventually and he was a high school sports star. One year out of high school, the hole opened back up and he had emergency open heart surgery. He was single vacksed and got covid twice, with no coughing which the doctors thought could have been the reason for the hole re-opening.   
He also nearly died waiting 26 hours in the ER, but that's another issue.Drink olive oil! It’s great for your cardiovascular system. Eat blackseed (nigella Sativa or something like that)I think the excess deaths kinda told it already.I think this video I made reflecting the last few years makes sense in this thread. 
https://youtu.be/TST6lNafSyEBut it confirms beliefs, so it’s fine.I read earlier today from a commenter that “myocarditis and pericarditis are extremely common because of the common cold”

Are those people in the room with us also?That would have to be a pretty big room so I would say no.Well this was t a world study. I’m sure they are.Yeah, these American’s bad hearts surely aren’t coming from obesity or high BP, only Covid vaccines lol. 🤦🏼‍♀️Your "buddies" wife and your aunt have health issues therefore vaccine bad?

Sure thing.All they had to do was hide for a couple of years and this thing would go away on its own.In this case they’re scaring you *not* to take somethingThat's like a 5 pack a day cig smoker saying .. Ive been smoking for 2 years, see nothing. 15 years later.. dead. Give it time.If you had a few thousand heart muscle cells killed by the vaccine, you might not even notice that, but your heart is now permanently weaker.Does it work though? Has it been "proven"? How's your heart? Good circulation? Do you avoid the unjabbed?There are a few doctors who are trying to figure out how to help. One thing I've seen recommended is fasting - it clears out all of the damaged cells in your body through a process called autophagy.

Another recommendation I've seen a lot is nattokinase. You can eat it as a food (it's Asian) or take a supplement.

You can start your research here, if you're interested, it's a link to a substack but it has a study in it:

https://open.substack.com/pub/mathewaldred/p/degradative-effect-of-nattokinase?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=webAh well I’m glad they laid out all the research they’ve done, or all the sources that led them to the claims they are making - I would hate if anyone just accepted what they said on face value, but I’m sure with all the skeptics here, that wouldn’t be the case. 

From the esteemed Dr Thomas Levy who advocates for inhaling hydrogen peroxide as a prophylactic/cure for covid with no research at all to prove it?Population control works if these 100mil die young.   If they die when they're 60 its not really population control is it, especially if they had kids who had grand kids.You still clinging to this instead of accepting that the science was wrong? 

Critical thinking should tell you that nothing is more easily bought than a scientist, numerous studies bought and paid for and the scientists behind it take the money and run.Plot twist — they DO cause that.I’m not sure what you’re trying to say… It’s harmful to our health so it can be harmful to our health?Half the people who took the shot.Canada had them all over the place before covid. Every public building has to have them and pretty much every  business has an AED availableIf these cells are living inside of everyone who got a covid vaccine, why aren't they showing up in every single blood/tissue workup? Hospitals do thousands of these tests every dayRumble... tsk! tsk!

Three years you guys have being like "trust the science tsk! tsk!"

Now here you are... "trust the science bro!"

Make up your mind!The amount of excessive deaths that would confirm 100 million damaged hearts hypothesis would be massive. On the order of millions."may have caused".

 This is like deviant comedy. All evidence points to it, yet no-one is willing to put a definite point to it. The whole world is tipe-toe'ing around the obvious, for what? Is this is a slow exposure? A controlled release of an obvious narrative (Like the spars narrative?). 

 TL:DR, get to the fucking point. The billions of people who took mRNA vaccines have been intentionally poisoned for depopulation & profit. 

 There. I said it.Was the commenter talking about 100 million cases in the US only, or a realistic number of cases? 
Also, Myocarditis and pericarditis are usually not considered severe heart damage.[Maybe.](https://expose-news.com/2022/11/23/died-suddenly-75-million-in-2022-covid-vaccine/)we do have world data for deaths and there isn't any large increase of them in countries that have far better vaccination rates than the USHealth issues from the vaccine and yes, vaccine bad.The government and media knows all they have to do is put some fear in people and grossly exaggerate it to manipulate and push people in a certain direction, it worked well enough for the nazis and it seems many of the worlds governments adopted that, especially the ones who took in former nazi scientists, intellectuals and propagandists.remember guys. eating food causes death because 100% of people who eat food dieExactly! Give it time. Eventually we all will die and it was definitely the vax.So.. if they die when they're old are you going to blame the vaccine?Actually the Vaccine Fairy said my heart grew three sizes. I'm unstoppable now.

See, we can both make up fairy tales!I have jabbed and unjabbed friends, been jabbed 4 times myself, all my blood tests are within normal limits, and am in the best shape of my life. I was told by antivaxxers that I’d be dead within 6 weeks, 2 months, 6 months, no more than a year, a zombie after 2 years, and now there are so many time estimates all “proven” by some scientist somewhere that I’m pretty sure I’ve died 7 times already by ya’ll’s count.Sorry, not dead yet. Keep hoping, dumbass.Nah trust Fauci instead, his track record is pristineDo you just respond this stupid to anything? It literally said there could be potential heart damage which should raise concerns and we need to continue evaluating and researching them. He never said stop now. He said, let’s fucking science and make sure this shit isn’t fucking us worse than actual Covid before we write off the fact that people are most likely making billions at the expense of our health.Maybe you should look into the definition of critical thinkingI'm pretty sure a politician is the scum of the earth and will do anything for a laugh let alone a dollar.Looks like the syntax of a bot tbh.Who says they aren't? Most people don't even know what to look for. That's the true problem. If you watch the presentation even the doctor who was asking around as to what she was seeing, most people didn't know. Until she found the right doctor who said it looks like venom peptides.Would be interesting to see fertility status, I bet the vax messes with the sperm maturing in the epididymis. Which  most likely won't show up on bloodtests.You know what's funny, several countries and jurisdictions began to block the sales of tobacco products right when these injections came out. I think they know that nicotine can help keep you from dying from these injections. Even in my city of Washington DC they just started banning menthol cigarettes for some reason. But yet they've been on sale for 40 years up to this point. Why? Most people smoke menthol cigarettes. Ain't that a bitch?It's hard to "trust the science" on vaccine safety and efficacy when they eliminated the control group after 5 months of study, and then told states to stop counting breakthrough cases as soon as it became clear that the vaccinated were getting Covid anyway.

I would have expected a bit more rigor.I don't know who you're referring to, but I've always trusted science. But I do not trust scientists who have been paid to say that everything is just fine. And that's why I heavily mess with Rumble. These are scientists who have not been bought off. Scientists who actually care about the health and welfare of humanity. They're not in the pockets of Pfizer and Moderna. All I'm telling people do is to just go watch the presentation with an open mind. My jaw is still on the floor but I am so glad that I did not take those injections. Something in my spirit said "You better not do that shit."OP's title is incorrect.

"Dr. Levy believes that a minimum of 7 million Americans have suffered heart damage due to Covid vaccines. While it is difficult to ascertain the exact number, he suggests that over 100 million people in the United States may have some degree of heart damage that can be detected using a Troponin test. "> The amount of excessive deaths that would confirm 100 million damaged hearts hypothesis would be massive.

Maybe and maybe not. Having a damaged heart doesn't automatically mean you drop dead.

There'd be varying levels of damage. So you'd expect millions of people to start noticing problems after several years... and also for the deaths to be spread out over decades.

You'd also be looking for this effect to show up as (or at least contribute to) an overall drop in life expectancy.

If memory serves, about 7500 people die every day in the US. You could add an extra 2% and that would be... 150/day extra. Over one year that's almost 55,000 people. Over 20 years, it's about 1.1 million.

Over a generation (40 years) that's 2.2 million... and the only sign would be a statistically minor increase.Well vaccine or COVID? Many vaccine attributed blood clots were actually from COVID!> The billions of people who took mRNA vaccines have been intentionally poisoned for depopulation & profit.

But the depopulation isn't really happening, there are no above average death rates in European countries that have a far higher rate of vaccination>There. I said it.

Nobody who took the vaxx is going to listen. Why not?

Because (even if you're 100% right) this knowledge would make them feel bad. That's why you can lie your ass off about "safe and effective" and nobody'd ever gonna call you out on it. It's a lie, but it makes vaxxed people feel good. So they accept the lie and love the ones who keep lying to them.Lot of folks could take 10 years and still be very young if the VAX caused it, bottom line it is 100% a shot in the dark literally nobody knows, a lot of people bet their future on something that has no long-term testing behind it.https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/09/13/493739074/50-years-ago-sugar-industry-quietly-paid-scientists-to-point-blame-at-fat

It is bad for you.Yes Iv read some studies and oddly enough my coworkers who smoke never got covid and they were the ones who took 3-4 shots lol so idk. Smoking is def no bueno but nicotine is supremeNah you guys are just deliberately distorting facts. For starters, this was an accelerated program and most scrutinized program too... Otherwise antivaxxers wouldn't be able to be making all kinds of dumb interpretations cause ... The data and n shit was out there. I mean look at me, not a medical whatnot here arguing with you about this bullshit like we know what the fuck we are talking about. Can you say the same for any other vaccine development? Measles, polio, shingles, chicken pox, the one flu vax of the 80s that was fucked up? Do you even know who /when etc etc they came out with chicken pox/shingle? No. But this time around, everyone and their mama got a thing to say to say about this coz ... Surprise... DATA AND INFORMATION IS FUCKING OUT THERE. PROBLEM IS MOST OF US DONT HAVE THE SCIENCE BACKGROUND TO INTERPRET IT AND COME TO RHE MOST DUMBASS CONCLUSION! 

Second new science was used ... Meaning old methods of doing shit wwere not needed and are not really going to be needed in future. You know thats how new tech replaced old tech. But guess dumbasses are like treat the paper the way papyrus is treated. No you can't! New science , who dis?

Third a boatload of money and resources was poured in + all hands were on deck, everything else was dropped and the focus was on this one thing... Kinder like how they did it in WW2.  Makes me wonder if antivaxxers were alive back in WW2, you guys would be like radar and all that other shit that was rushed developed ... You'd all be like it's a hoax or some other dumb nonsense 

You expected rigor. Lol what do you think they have been doing the whole time? Shot in arm go on your way? They are and have been collecting data, analyzing etcetc and in realtime. New tech, new methods. mRNA is a tech that they have been working on for like 20+ years. COVID pandemic and boatload of cash and resources was just the perfect "happy" intersection. Pushed developed another 20+ years ahead of time!

But antivaxxers are still stuck on we need 3/5 years... Not with the new tech and the money/resources they have/had. They can run whatnot in parallel and in much shorter time... You know the goal of new tech. Doing shit faster and quicker!Lol...  You know these grifters are on rumble because they are filling a niche. As in you are paying them to confirm your bias... All them views n shit... You know they grifting are grifting you ... Such an easy mark!

If they were not grifters, they'd present their bullshit funding to their peers and duke it out over there. But, they know they can't support their bullshit so rumble it is!There's no way to tell whether it was Covid, the vaccine, or both -- thanks to the fact that they eliminated the control group after five months of testing.  Plus, almost every vaccinated person ended up getting Covid anyway.  How convenient!The fiber like clots only started to be found after the covid shots were rolled out.  If such clots also would have been caused by covid they would have been found earlier (and probably used to scare the crap out of everybody so they will get the shots).Excess deaths in the UK: https://magspress.com/bbc-news-finally-admits-covid-vaccines-caused-excess-deaths-in-2022/

 These are just 2 countries I pulled from Europe + more. There's more on France, Italy, Ireland and so forth. No idea how you can make that comment with such blatant evidence surrounding you. Your comment is the definition of misinformation.The vax nearly killed me. I accept that I fell for the lie. Wish I hadn’t. Maybe if the internet wasn’t so censored I would have seen information that I didn’t and reconsidered. No way I’m letting my children get it.We don't what, have death rates from literally any EU country?So maybe it would be easy to pay off someone to fudge data and make it seem like the vaccine is harmful also? I mean the payoffs can go both ways.. I know two people locally in my sphere of acquaintances who died of COVID19. One was Overweight. The other was a slightly overweight smoker. 

I don’t know anyone who knows anyone who had a vaccine complication.Vaping nicotine could actually save some lives. If it keeps those venom peptides from attaching to receptors and doing damage, then you'd better start vaping if you took those shots. In nature there's an answer to every problem that ails man, the only problem is we turned our backs on her. And for that there are consequences.I have no idea what you're talking about. The mainstream is not going to allow the narrative of "everything is just fine" to be destroyed. Most of these doctors are paid to say that "everything is just fine". But there are many doctors who are not bought off and are yelling out that something is extremely wrong. These people don't have anything to gain by telling people that they're potentially dying. This is not about likes or views or none of that other bullshit. This is real life and people are suffering and losing their lives from these injections. Maybe if you watch it you can enlighten yourself and understand how serious this really is.Never got Covid myself. Although I may have been vaccinated against SARS in Korea in 2002!Absolutely no doubt.  Would have been #1 on the fear list.I’ll look into it more. The fact is coupled with our already high heart issues in the us we don’t need more shit compounding.Honestly? 

The treatment, everyone knew pretty quickly that if they put you on the ventilator you were done for.

Propagandists and their minions were screaming about horse wormers but it turned out Hydroxychloroquine was the answer didn’t it? 

People died because of poor treatment.

And if you are lucky enough not to know people affected by the vaccine then I’m pleased for you, I know people who were bright and vivacious fading away since that vaccine and they cannot figure out what is wrong with them.You are right, there is no way to deduce things from large population statistics any more. We are all reduced to 17th century method of what is going on with our close circle and their close circle. If you see that a lot of people in your close circle are getting sick after taking the vaccine, maybe do not do that.


**”Propagandists and their minions were screaming about horse wormers but it turned out Hydroxychloroquine was the answer didn’t it?”**

No. Straight up no. Data from multiple separate studies confirmed over and over hydroxychloroquine was not effective against COVID. Large studies showed 0 outcome differences from those who took it to those who took nothing. 

And Merck Pharmaceuticals, the manufacturer of Ivermectin says explicitly on their website that Ivermectin has 0 efficacy against COVID19. Basically if you took Ivermectin and felt better, you may have had some kind of a parasite in your guts. 

**”And if you are lucky enough not to know people affected by the vaccine then I’m pleased for you, I know people who were bright and vivacious fading away since that vaccine and they cannot figure out what is wrong with them.”**

Maybe they got COVID and it slowed them down? COVID had me very messed up for the better part of a year before the vaccine came out.So you took more spike protein to fix the previous spike protein?

Ok lolVaccines sort of work like that. You get a version that your body can deal with so when you get the real thing, the body knows how to fight it.

Also not a direct comparison but remember Anti-venom is made directly from venom and cultivating antibodies. Sometimes the treatment is full circle.Is this classical vaccines or those rolled out since they changed the definition to suit their narrative? 

Impressive mental gymnastics 🥇RFK Jr's daughter in law is a former CIA agent. Her step father is a billionaire that owns a mega corporation which owns Integrated DNA Technologies and other DNA/RNA companies. IDT produced COVID tests during the pandemic.How ironic that RFK Jr's own family profited from the COVID pandemic whole RFK Jr claims to oppose such corruption. RFK Jr has enlisted the help of former CIA agent Amaryllis Fox to help with his campaign. Fox's step father is a billionaire who owns mega corporation Fortive. The holdings of Fox's step father include companies that directly profited from the COVID pandemic. 

Amaryllis Fox also did a movie with CNN and the Weinstein Co and her daughter's name coincidentally means "from dark to light," which was a popular slogan of GlowAnon. And Fox developed an algorithm to identify terrorists and security risks and advocated for white supremecy being the main cause of the war on terrorism in a blog post in 2017. 

Did RFK Jr. disclose in his book that his daughter in law's family was involved in selling COVID specific products during the pandemic? If not, any leave out such information? Or that his daughter in law helped create an algorithm central to global surveillance and social credit systems (and supposedly the Chinese use a similar algorithm to classify citizens as risks)? 

Before falling for hopium again, it may be worthwhile to consider why RFK Jr would retain a former CIA operative who developed a human risk assessment algorithm and whose billionaire stepfather owns companies that made covid tests and own DNA/RNA related corporations.###[Meta] Sticky Comment

Some of them are assholes, and some of them are American heroes.Daughter in laws step father's brothers cousin's sister.... FohHis daughter-in-law’ STEPFATHER is your issue?  Man, talk about grasping at strawsSo what? Is RFK supposed to control who his kids marry?My nephew works for the DOD.  

If you look at my post history you'll find I have nothing good to say about the CIA/DOD etc.

Your "point" is stupid.Trump and kushner is a more sus connectionIt doesn’t matter who his family is or does or what companies they own. It doesn’t matter what he has said in the past. 

He is going against the narrative now!
He is waking people up and giving those on the left especially, a person they will consider his views an allow them to break through there “programming”. 

Most of you who bag on him for anything are still stuck in your own programming and biases and can’t see the big picture. 

We live in a media propaganda matrix controlled directly by the CIA. Most of you are still too brainwashed to see it, even though it is blatantly obvious (if you are offended by what I am saying that means subconsciously you know I am talking about you!). Denying it is a primitive defense mechanism of your ego called cognitive dissonance. 
Wake up! We are in a PsyOp war with our own government.

RFK jr. has awakened to this. Better late than never. His words right now are doing more than any other person than maybe Tucker Carlson to fight this propaganda machine. We are living in a very dangerous time and most people have no clue, still. 

Our enemies not only control the government they literally control most peoples perception of reality! This is not exaggeration. 

RFK jr is putting his life on the line. Doesn’t matter what else he does or whether he becomes President. He is fighting the monolithic establishment we all are trapped under. The moral courage he is showing is inspiring.RFK Jr is no savior. Either is Trump.Really? Daughter in law is the best you got? You think RFK should be in control over who his son marries?

If your father told you who to marry, would you listen? If so you are a bitch who cannot think for themselves, always a childOh god, I’ve been waiting forever to say this: What political office is his daughter in law running for? /sRich people are connected this ain't nothing new. They go to very expensive schools just to networkThe first sentence explains it allWhat does the word "former" mean in this context?And he called Bullshit on the whole thing!!!While the CIA probably did plant her in his family, what happens when RFK jr destroys them? Or when society does? 

She could have also just met the person while on a work thing, who knows what the connection isI do agree that anyone wanting to be president should have a close eye on any part of their past that could pose conflict with holding office. 

His sons wife's stepfather seems like a far reach. 

Did RFK Jr. have financial gain directly?

If not, it just seems like a weak supported hit pieceSmoke and mirrors. Its ALL a show.Ray McGovern and Larry Johnson are former CIA agents who are actively fighting against the deep state. The key word is “former” CIA agent.Damn all the research for something that isn’t worth anything. Hope you had fun tho!We have no idea what's going on behind the scenes. If there ARE 2 warring factions of the military (one trying to wake people up, and one trying to put them back to sleep) then I'm sure you will have some people who look bad but are good, and some people who look good, but are bad. If they are doing a good job at fooling the other side, we won't be able to tell. So the best we can do is trust our gut.  Truth prevails in the end. TRUTH MAKES SENSE. But, do to AI and corrupt media, we are increasingly in a world that is totally confusing. Forget these puppets, and focus on what makes sense.Too bad she isn't a crack head.

>Moderna, Inc. (Nasdaq:MRNA), and Aldevron have announced their expanded collaboration in support of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine and additional programs in Moderna’s clinical development pipeline. Specifically, Aldevron will supply plasmid DNA to serve as the genetic template for generating the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine and other investigational programs in Moderna’s pipeline.

Looks pretty sus to me.It's called controlled opposition.I thought this guy was our newest savior!Well that’s a slam dunk to the rfk shill post from the other day. I wonder what that dude has to say about this lmao. People in here saying that DIL and her step father would not be close to rfk sound like basement dwellers with no familyTrump and the J&J/vaccine connections to are sus.Is he probably a corporate puppet like the rest? Yes.
May he gets killed by the military industrial complex? 
Also, yes. 
Now that's a candidate I can get behind.Same way how Ecohealth Alliance received federal money for gain of function research in the Wuhan lab, knowing fully well that it was an insecure facility located in the city known as China’s transportation hub (Wuhan), also knowing that a pandemic would be one way to weaken China’s social fabric and cause unrest.Exactly. Rich people fight over money all the time and try to use us as tools to redistribute more money to them while they lie about giving us a bigger share.I'm sorry, but I severely giggle every time a George Carlin reference is made. Please take my upvote. 

I use this phrase all the time when people talk politicsYeah, and RFK Jr. has said that some people in his family hate him.He deserves a chance. A lot of garbage posted on here about him.Didn’t JFK get elected due to the mafia or something?RFK JR said he would be, “a champion for Israel”.  Anyone too afraid to draw a line in the sand and call out human rights abusers is just another piece of shit worthless politician.Did you miss the part where she is former CIA?My brother in law is an ATF agent. I'll let you guess how Thanksgiving conversations go lol.Except the pushback on the vaccine program was all worked into the plan. It’s spelled out very clearly in spars.>Really? Daughter in law is the best you got?

What does this mean?

>If so you are a bitch who cannot think for themselves, always a child

Oh look you're resorting to insults! How adult like! 

Why are you acting so emotionally connected to politician?>what happens when RFK jr destroys them?

Did RFK Jr say he was going to abolish the CIA? RFK Jr just said in a recent interview that 90% of CIA officers are patriots. I don't see abolishing the CIA on RFK Jr's campaign website. 

>She could have also just met the person while on a work thing

Her step father actually raised her and has owned mega corporations and been a billionaire for quite some time.If people can be "former" cia agents, can people be "former" WEF members?A massive dong would also check a handful of boxes as well for them.> RFK Jr's daughter in law's step father

That's quite a mouthful and a desperate reach of a smearI was a supporter of RFK Jr……..until I saw him bending the knee and spouting crap about how he would be, “a champion for Israel”.  Same load of hot garbage bullshit every politician repeats.  Until someone finally decides to go against the grain and call out Israel for the human rights abusers they are, then I’ll continue to abstain from engaging in the political bullshit game.His father got shot, so if he should be the savior to protect mankind he would get some minerals right into his head. But he is walking from podcast to street protest and nobody kills him. 

there are no truther today who don’t get suicided when they are a threat to the system.Why complain? Just look into Monero and start to use it. It's what Bitcoin missed to become - private digital cash.

Freedom and privacy are rights to be taken, not to be given by some authority...it’s the same club they use to beat you over the head with all day long when they tell you what to believe.Some family members penned an article denouncing him publicly as a crackpot some years ago. He joked about it in his campaign announcement speech.I’m sure there’s a big battle of “let’s shut up and stop making us a target” & “let’s continue to defy those that threaten us and be hero’s”Garbage posted by tribals that don't realize they are both eating at the same trough.hey i understood that referenceAnd? CIA in what capacity? What’s your view, that everyone that has ever worked for the CIA MUST have been part of some elaborate, coordinated effort to dismantle our system? Take a deep breath, friendCame here for the “Hunter Biden isnt our president” people but this will do. Same shitYep. RFK Jr. is controlled opposition at best.I'm not sure they can kill any high profile people without risking everybody losing their shit. why didn't they just kill Assange?everyone who is working for them is denying the buttload of atrocities the CIA did to mankind. No normal being with an internet connection join them with good intentionsThat doesn’t change anything about the circumstances being sus. What are the odds that former CIA marries into the family before he announces a presidential bid. 

If you think there’s nothing suspicious about that then I’m not sure what to tell you.Hate to say it but it's hard to deny this. It definitely appears this way.

History has always proven that anyone who poses a threat to opposition is gone sooner rather than later but we'll see how this political theatre plays outThat's why he supports Bitcoin (transparent, easily surveilled) over Monero (private by default, decentralized).He 100% is.  Watch some of the videos where he slobs on Israel’s knob.  Same old crap.when does this controlled opposition thing start to become a catch all?Odds are high, CIA not only has loads of former employees but they also purposely infiltrate families of possible wealth and future power.When i think of the CIA. First thing that comes to mind is big Kennedy fans. Including the guy who is publicly saying they killed his uncleIf you believe this, then what exactly are you doing about the destruction of our government and freedoms? The situation you envision means America, it’s culture, and it’s laws are gone.  Is that what you believe?WSJ: JPMorgan Says Ex-First Lady of U.S. Virgin Islands Helped Epstein Traffic WomenHow far does this really go?

And the federal government doesn’t really need assets when they have the power to tax.The criminals who rake in huge collection and "service" fees  invest heavily  in politicians to make sure socialized loansharking  resumes at full speed. Debt and associated misery are also good for military and corporate recruiters. Without the debt sentence every day, people could get an education and emerge in position to compete with trust fund babies. 

It might change if the propagandized hurr durr StUdEnT BaD pAy BilLs trolls  were ever got their heads out  of their  oppressors' asses but that's a long shot the yacht hoarding tax dodging oligarchs have a lot invested in this effective propaganda. Divide and conquer is a time-tested strategy

Seeing the trolls ( perhaps  an angry  multiboxer) line up to shill for oligarchs  banksters and big government on a conspiracy sub is funny/sadIt’s no wonder that college in American films, is shown as this fun place, where you have everything you’d ever want as a 18 year old, like sex, beer and hardly any studying but I remember my sister saying in the U.K, that many people do degrees over here, they do no placements in the free time they have at uni, so don’t have the experience to get a job after finishing uni, with the 10 grand a year debt you now have.

My sister got lucky and only had one year at 10k but the other 3 years was 3 grand a year. She also did a master and was told she couldn’t work whilst doing it, but the bank wouldn’t fund her for it. She’s now on £30 plus pounds an hour, a lot for this country but has a lot of student debt for things like housing, books and just living. She worked in the summer months tho.


Uni used to be free in the U.K, until the late 1990s.And funny enough our education system is so fucked. Mental health education? Nope. Language proven easy to learn before puberty? Take spanish, french, or whatever in highschool. And accepting only one method when other methods exist. Aka the student learned the thing but did it differently. There are several ways to do the quadratic formula. Sorry it makes grading take longer. We need to make education a job that is paid well. These are just what's on the surface.We do not advice people soundly enough against themThe percentage of student loans is even higher than taxes, assets and others in the picture. What happened to the student loan is really unfair because the tax payers are the ones who shouldered the repayment of the student loans.You can declare bankruptcy in America, but the only debt you can’t get rid of is a student loan. (Unless you are an offspring of a member of the US congress )Assets?  Isn't the military an asset? What about Black Project expenditures?  You really think they're broke?Want to know why student tuition can be over $80,000 per year? See chart.Mine just got forgiven, just had to work for the government for 10 years. Google PSLFSS: Student loans will never be forgiven.Will home prices go down when payments resume?OK, who's going to post this to Politics?LMAO! After serving in the military the best thing that I have learned is never EVER trust the government and what they say.  I remember so many times when they would either take away benefits or reduce benefits for active duty military when just months before politicians would say "We will never take anything away from our troops!" I can't count how many times when tuition assistance for college was suspended for certain amount of time or was reduced.  Fuck the government and fuck any politician that promises outrageous shit like student loan forgiveness.I don’t believe this graph for a second lolTrying to get loan forgiveness is like talking to a brick wall, they've already signed the contract. Instead, people should be going straight to the source and campaigning for university costs to be more affordable. If university was more affordable, future generations wouldn't have to worry about haggling with the government on payments.

There is just too much bureaucratic bloat in the modern university system. The books are insanely overpriced, there are too many professors nobody cares about getting massive tenure pay, too many overpaid board members that do nothing for students, cramming way too many students in a single lecture hall but never reducing the price... it just goes on and on.Imagine paying only minimums on your student loans. 

Lol. lmao“We’re going to forgive student loan debt” lolThe government should be regulating how much debt Americans have, not taking an active role in it.Someone owing you money is not an asset. As you may never get it back. Just like you loaning to a friend you’d like to get it back but you need to accept you might not either. So don’t loan out money if you can’t loan it out and need the money.The government can only give



what it takes from some one else.Nor should they be forgiven.
 
 
 
Accessibility to high dollar amounts via an unlimited pool of money driving costs of tuition high is one topic, but, these loans were still taken out, signed for, and disbursed, so they should be paid back.
 
 
 
Playing the ignorance card isn’t an excuse. What job did you think your liberal arts degree was going to get? 
 
 
 
And the Master Promissory Note is pretty clear, this money needs to get paid back.
 
 
 
Forgiveness doesn’t address the root cause, it was just bad policy from a dying Bernie campaign that Biden had to make it look like he tried on. It still would have failed under Bernie too.It's too easy to dangle in front of gen x and millenials for some easy dem votes come election yearStudent loan forgiveness is great and all but if it doesn’t come with fixes to the system then it’s pointless. 

The problem isn’t having a loan it’s having a loan for an education where the costs are getting out of control with not necessarily high level of education. My last year I had more adjuncts then anything and you could tell. Every not and then one would be great but they were an exception. 

The interests rates are also basically bullshit. Only a small piece covers the administrative cost which should be the only thing needed for government assisted education. 

They use banks to give the loans, which are 100% guaranteed by the government to the bank, then give them a cut of the percent. They are making money without any risk to just act like a middleman.Because it was always a ponzi / pyramid scheme and all of your institutions are corrupt.

When shit hits the fan will you be able to take care of yourself?

If no then you didn’t learn anything of value in school.

The government will Always be your master even when they commit heinous acts of evil.

Good luck.Because poor people borrow money to take rich kid classes.

If you're taking out a loan for college, you have to treat it a trade school.  Can't take that money just to "broaden your horizons" like the rich kid did, because you're not going to be as ok as they are.  They can take art history, and still get the job.  You can't.  You have to go to college to make some money.  There's no college experience.  You have to work.If you went to college and took on insane amounts of debt to fund it, I’m sorry, but you got playedThe proper humane thing to do is to fund the education and create the concept of a 13th and 14th grade that would be trade or the starting point equivalent of an associates degree. 

&#x200B;

We need mental health specialists and several other fields like teachers desperately, but no one wants to do them because of the giant load of debt , lack of respect, and low pay.It's an election vote narrative nothing more.  I'm sure they will use it again in 2024 and again the brainwashed will buy the empty promises. Ha.  It's like Lucy with the football, Charlie never learns.Bankruptcy doesn't make them go away.

No job? "Fuck you, pay me."
Not enough income to live "Fuck you pay me."

Your mother died and your house burned down? "Fuck you, pay me."Student loans will never be forgiven because it's a massive wealth transfer from working people without college educations, responsible people who paid back their own loans, and people with private loans that wouldn't be covered under the suggested programs,  to a relatively small percentage of high earning potential elites.

This small percentage of people has an outsized and over amplified voice at the moment.  But the vast majority of the population doesn't support itFirst off, it shouldn't be free.   
Second, it wasn't nearly as expensive until the government got involved in it.Social Security trust funds: $34.2 trillion

  
Treasury securities held by the public: $27.2 trillion

  
Federal employee retirement funds: $11.3 trillion

  
Government-owned enterprises: $4.9 trillion

  
Miscellaneous assets: $2.4 trillionRemember when banks got “bailed out”? If any percentage of student loans was ever “forgiven” the US Govt would effectively “bail itself out” dollar for dollar on any “forgiven asset”. It would be almost the same as printing money.I don't understand why they'd be forgiven?


If you take a loan, you pay it back.


The whole system needs reforming, schools need to stop  being ranked on how many students go onto higher education. But don't use a whole pot of the lower and middle classes paid taxes to pay off the debts of the suburban kids who are so used to having mommy and daddy bail them out.


The government aren't raising out children, teach them to be accountable.Assets? The globalist criminals, who have hijacked the government and financial system, can print all of the fiat that they want. The reason why student loan debt won't be forgiven is because it keeps the leftists dependent and, therefore, controlled.Pay back your debts you deadbeats.Who cares? The whole system's about to blow.Everyone needs to hear this: student loan forgiveness doesn't mean the "lender" doesn't get repaid, it means the lender gets repaid with tax money.How exactly does this money go to the government?The federal government generates over $3 trillion of revenue each year just from federal student loans. There will never be any major reform to the student loan program. It's a very profitable hidden education tax that Congress is unwilling to sacrifice. Those in Congress who advocate for student loan reform campaign on it, knowing that such reforms would never get Congressional approval.The poor pay for everything and the rich enjoy the spoils.What do you mean "forgiven"? That money has been spent. You mean "paid for by others who didn't make your purchase, while you get to keep the degree".It's too late anyway, the damage has been done. Native Millennials are hitting 40 and many are not married or are childless. Gen Z will follow suit. Within a generation or two more there will be a huge decrease in population that no amount of immigrants can sustain.That isn't how citing a source works.Because adults who signed paperwork and agreed on terms to get loans should pay them back?Because it’s a stupid idea. That’s whyAlmost as if college were for suckers, huh? We come out all pretentious and hoity toity with our little paper degrees but a lifetime of racked up debt 😅 HEY! At least we get to brag that we’re in the Graduate Club 😂 Only worth $250,000. What a deal!Student loan forgiveness is absurd anyway.

If you're going to just give people a direct subsidy, at least target those who need it. Don't give $200k in loan forgiveness to doctors, lawyers, and others who have a tremendous earning potential.college is the biggest scam goingThey should not be forgiven you took the loan out pay it back!!!You made the choice to borrow $200k for a sociology degree.  It’s not something taxpayers have any business paying.  My son joined the Air Force and the GI Bill paid his bachelors and mba.  Go serve your country there are lots of programs.  Your college financing choices are on you not usIt needs to be clear that the democrats have been trying to forgive student loans and the republicans block it every time.That's not the only reason.

What is the number one benefit you get from joining the military?I want to see canadas version of thisSure it’s big number… always will be.
But they can’t take away every earned collegiate degree.  It’s not easy to obtain….if it was, everybody would have one.  Always gonna be haters.
I said, go big or go home.Ah, that explains how the SS trust fund disappeared.How is miscellaneous bigger than the federal reservePeople act like they were forced to sign at gun point, or were never allowed to read the contract. I remember looking at the terms and thinking "No fucking way wood I agree to that!" when I was 17. You agreed to the terms, now deal with your decision. None of my trade school friends will get shit for making the right choice, and they don't deserve to pay for your mistake, nobody does except the person that signed the contract.It’s ok. I’ve already forgiven myself.What about the $4.5 Trillion in corporate debt the US Government purchased in March of 2020?


https://prospect.org/coronavirus/how-fed-bailed-out-the-investor-class-corporate-america/So students will bankrupt America?Does this chat include what he post office makes?The fact that these loans existed in the first place is the reason education costs are so high, and forgiving loans will just make them even higher. Want to lower education costs? Stop handing out loans and money.They will promise or hint it again come election time and the majority of the left will gobble it up without thinking for a second, againThe trillions that just went missing and they are worried about student loans. XD clownsWhat does “Financial Accounts of the Federal Government” actually mean in this graph? 

Student loans aren’t usually taken out directly from the government, are they?How about when they dangled student loan forgiveness in front of everyone while interest rates were 2% so most people didn’t refinance because there were no payments and no interest, and you can’t get your loans forgiven if they are not with a federal servicer, but now that interest rates are back up at 7% they are no longer doing that?So almost half the money is in stock and we are the stock. Nice.I’m really conflicted about this. I know what universities have become over time, but if they reverted to, you know, *teaching* instead of indoctrinating and inculcating, I would say that *every* capable citizen should have the choice of that level of education. I would also argue that it should be free. We should *all* want a better educated public. Yes, I know. The government or those in power obviously don’t want that, but in a vacuum, it’s better for us all if you have more high educated citizens. 

I also really don’t understand the mentality of fully grown adults and the vitriol they have towards current or very recently graduated students and not having to pay back their loans. Education should be free. Full stop. It’s for the betterment of all of us right now, in the near future, and in the long term. Yes, you paid off your loan, as did I. Yes, I made the uneducated decision to pursue this as a 17 year old as you likely did. The whole “I paid so why shouldn’t those younger than us?” is such short-sighted bullshit. Free education benefits us all, and if that’s the future, it has to start somewhere. 

Here’s an insane idea: take one one-thousandth of a percent of our *visible* military budget and provide free, secondary education for all citizens. Taxes don’t change or go up, kids get education without burying their entire future in debt. Win win.Odd that most government jobs, especially in some states and municipalities, have public service loan forgiveness along with a good salary and benefits. I think New York will pay for you to go back to school if you work for the state, at least a chunk of it, especially if it’s a state school. The military is different and clearly predatory based on not having college loans.The bank bailouts were at least loans and the government made back more than it bailed out.

If you really want to be outraged think PPP loans. Not only was it just straight forgiven, but the oversight was fired right at the start and the executive said they will do the oversight instead. No surprise lots of straight corruption.The one that happened right at the beginning of the cvid hoax?Our government just spent £700billion on ‘covid stuff’ and there’s crickets now that we have massive inflation lol *what did you think would happen*Capital assets (land, tanks, buildings, battleships, etc) are on a different part of the ledger.

I have no idea if 45% is the correct number but AR (which would include student loans) is absolutely part of "cash and cash equivalents."

Edit: I did this on my phone but got home and looked things up. The government has more outstanding student loans than the value of every building they have ever built in the history of the USA put together. 

The correct number is roughly 30% and the interest rate of 6.8% (or whatever student loans already are) is already heavily subsidized.Holy fuck I never even connected the “college is amazing” thing as an advertisement. Goddam.Wait a minute... One of the main arguments people use for student loan forgiveness in the US is that it's free in the UK... that's a lie?Agreed. A true counselor/advisor in high school would be telling at least 50% of their students not to take predatory loans for an education they won’t/can’t use.So you are arguing that we should have told people not to take low interest loans to get an education?classified as capital assets i think so considered separateOhh no. People being held accountable for their decisions!And they shouldn't be.


Or if they do they should pay me too, I paid off my useless loan with hard work and sacrifice.

In fact just gimme your money its not fair that you probably have more than meI oppose student loan forgiveness, but support student loan refunds.

If you don't use your degree within 4 years after graduation, you should have the right to return it to the university/bank.https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/reports-statements/financial-report/balance-sheets.html

Then, drilling down on "Note 4."

https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/files/reports-statements/financial-report/2022/notes-to-the-financial-statements4.pdfGoogle what is the federal government’s biggest assetUniversity costs used to be more affordable before the government started underwriting it.  Blame government and universities.A schools purpose is to educate, yet they have huge endowments, bring in tons of money from patents, research, and sports.  I think all schools should be forced to pay for 80% of their sudents tuition.  I bet they lobby against schools just so they can keep raising tution and making it admin heavy.  They've lost their way.When I was getting my degrees, tuition was raised.. by a vote, casted by none other than "Student Board" 
I'm sure those assholes got a nice payday.I mean... anyone can campaign on it, dem or reb.Actually the US gov cut banks out of the equation a while ago. The US issues the debt ..Student loan forgiveness is a terrible idea and counterproductive. What we need to do is roll back the changes that Joe Biden and Mitch McConnell made in 2005 that made student loans non-dischargable in bankruptcyI would agree if it wasn't for the fact that it's children making these choices. If you are 17 never had a full time job, never supported yourself and had almost every adult in your life telling you to go to college. You got taken advantage of.

We need to stop banks and universities from taking advantage of childrenBecause I’m banned from so many subs I have nowhere to post things like thisNo need for election gimmicks when the cemetery votes are guaranteed…"As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster" - Every Politician.Just like your car payment, electric bill and anything else.

2020: "Just another 5 years"Only a couple more weeks and the pillow guy will finally reveal everything!That is collected from John q. Public . The cycle,like change, is constantIt would be nice to see that money do more than build weapons or fund war.  A lot of people get awfully worked up over getting something back from the government that we pay into.  It works that way everywhere else, but here we're brainwashed into thinking that these are "handouts", while they use our money to bail out corporations that fund politicians campaigns or hold their investments.. or make excuses to spend it with weapons contractors in between wars because we truly care about some other nation.No the money went from banks to the pockets of democrats who created this system.It doesn't, this graph is a complete fabrication. The government just guarantees the loans so that private lenders can reap the profits, which is actually worse than if they were lending out the money themselves for profitOnly thing I know for sure is that at the end of the day all of this money is actually going to the universities, and no one here is mentioning that fact.My sources are financial accounts, because they account for finances from financial accounts.Isn't it sort of funny that literally everyone else can declare bankruptcy, that corporations and banks can get bailed out over and over and over again, that the Rich can constantly get tax breaks and free money from things like the PPP. But students who are barely adults and got horribly taken advantage of by predatory lending institutions, that's where you draw the line? Those are the people who should be stuck in debt forever and get no help?Many many young impressionable people are taught and shown that the only way forward is an expensive ass education. You probably like to believe that everyone you don't like had some dumb useless liberal degree but many people even with decent jobs are struggling due to student loans and a big boon to the middle class would be a forgiveness of these loans and a restructuring of the system thats one of many designed to abuse Americans which you apparently don't give a fuck about.You would've turned in runaway slaves.Thousand of private trade schools sprung up in response to these loans.  Predatory.200k in forgiveness?? Where the hell did you get that number from? It’s only up to 20K. SMH200K for a sociology degree? And why would the gi bill pay for an mba? Sounds like the country served him, for what a 4-5 year tour of duty? With such incentives is it really valid to call it "serve your country"? Seems like he was paid very well to "serve", right?So you are saying that the GOP isn’t letting those that went to college hand their debt that couldn’t afford to go, that is a big endorsement for the GOP.Give it a break.  It’s not “vitriol” it’s common sense.  You take out a loan, you pay it back.  You don’t hand billions of dollars of debt you signed up for to people who didn’t.> inculcating

: to teach and impress by frequent repetitions or admonitionsThis s idea that the bank bailouts were fine because they were paid back with interest completely ignores that the infusion of capital directly negated the risk of the banks bad behavior. The final cost of that is still tbd and playing out in real-time before our eyesThey made back more because they charged people more fees at banks...I think the whole "forcefully lockdown the population with blaintant constitutional violations that they got around by saying "hey its not us doing it its private companies (after we threatened them if they didn't)"" that caused the need for PPP "loans" in the first place was far worse.


Giving companies money because you told them they just couldn't operate anymore isn't a bailout, it's fixing your own massive fuckup.Covid stimulus and shutdowns could certainly be seen as a bailout, not just for banks but money was thrown all around for instance at the airlines and various medical enterprises that never will need to pay it back and can rack up profits instead.If 10 years is right before sure.this was the source I found but couldn't confirm the 45%

[https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/20180607/z1.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/20180607/z1.pdf)Student loans are not A/R. They’re loans receivable, and they’re not “cash and cash equivalents.” A cash equivalent is a highly liquid asset that can readily be converted to cash, like a treasury security or certified deposit.Why do you think films like old school, jump street, American pie 2 and may more, paint a picture that isn’t based in reality, at all.It was free in the UK until recently. Not the case any more. Most of Europe is still freeIn New Zealand the loans are interest free at least.There’s a lot of people that shouldn’t have gone to college but went because they think that’s the desirable path whether they can handle the workload or not, whether they pick a worthwhile degree or not, whether they use their loan for a lower cost state school and live at home frugally, or out of state higher cost party school.   
Teenagers often make bad decisions because theyre not great at looking at the big picture and instead want the path that makes them happy now.   
A good chunk of them probably should have gone to trade school but most of those classes to lead them in that direction were removed from high school programs.what's this about low interest?I know the lower-end schools were predatory.  Kid goes to check out the school, can't afford it. they send them them to a desk, papers are presented on the spot.  Kid signs.  No questions asked.  No tuition owed, no questions answered.I had a full ride to Cornell (poor area good at baseball, even tho baseball didn’t generally give full rides at that time they always find workarounds) dropped out to gamble sophomore year in college. That had its up and downs, but I managed to do it for a living for more than a decade. The downs coincides with me meeting my wife and having kids, so I looked for work. Due to a lot of bad decisions I am a convicted felon. Even as a convicted felon I still make more money than I would have probably had I continued at Cornell. 

I ended up in sales, background in gambling helps, easy transition, much easier than trying to beat oddsmaker lines. Point is there is a lot of ways to do things, and very few jobs that require a degree (which most don’t even if they say they do) are worth the time to actually have spent the money on the degree. I mean I’m lucky, for sure.

I would say that probably 80% of kids shouldn’t pursue higher education. Most jobs are dropping higher education pre req, and the ones that haven’t done that probably would and do. And even if you don’t have any of the “skills” employers are looking for, trade school, especially now is going to be booming. Too many seniors who are retiring, too few youth to fill the position.How convenient. Well I like to include them.  That budget is way too big!Can we put you down as against all bankruptcies?How would that work. You still have all the knowledge you were taught. Someone had to teach you, how are you gonna get a refund for the time and energy used? Giving back a degree doesn't give teachers or administration or anyone there time and energy backSame with stocks. You should be able to get a full refund for up to 4 years if they don't appreciate.That is not how the real world works.Governments are generally known for deficit spending and that's normal around the globe (ethics aside).  The bigger controversy here is that just the *increase* alone in military spending (pick any recent fiscal year) is enough to cover 4 years of college debt in the entire country.  The Pentagon can't even keep up with passing audits anymore, at least for the last 5 times but forgiving college debt is out of the question for the country.  

Priorities.I’m glad you are so generous with money that doesn’t belong to you.

That and a nickel will get you… well, 3 cents after taxes.Better idea, schools need to cosign all student loans. If they don't feel like their students can pay back the loans then they should reevaluate their pricing, their career development resources and the quality/content of their education> A schools purpose is to educate, yet they have huge endowments

A small number of them have large endowments, but a lot of them really don't.and at least democrats didn’t vote for retroactive paymentsCool… so why does my original loans still show a bank? I’m not that old (30’s. Government loan). Mine was literally funneled through a bank then sent to a loan servicer. If this was a change of policy, that’s great. Still doesn’t mean many existing loans weren’t affectedOkay so you agree absolutely no post-grad loans should be forgiven?Not children. 18 years old. High school graduates.  Some college.i wonder why you got banned lolBecause it's a massive trickle-up mechanism.The only shill I see here is the one calling people shills. A dirty look from a "student", he OBVIOUSLY separated "student"s into several salient categories many of which would never have received benefits under Biden's crackpot scheme.You have to admit that things are getting ridiculous for the working poor.There were massive crashes in the 1970s, 1980s, early 1990s, 2000s, and 2008. Covid sort of was one but the massive money printing essentially kicked the can down the road. That recession is most likely catching up to us now that interest has shot up. I would not be surprised if student loans kicking in are the final nail in the coffin causing a recession, there is a huge amount of money that's about to be pulled out of the retail market. 

Personally, I think causing a recession is actually the goal of the people pushing to restart student loan payments and retroactively apply interest. If the economy goes into a recession, the rich and corporations who just got billions in free money from covid and Trump tax breaks will be just fine, whereas Biden will be in real trouble come election season.https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/files/reports-statements/financial-report/2022/notes-to-the-financial-statements4.pdfStill, Biden's plan wasn't a cure for that. "help" is a lot broader than "forgiveness" even though his plan did have limits.When I bought a car, they could repo it until paid off.  Same thing with my house.  With the education that is your future I guess it’s the same thing.If you went to college and you aren’t making more than just about anyone who didn’t, look in the mirror to find someone who paid for an education and didn’t work hard enough to learn anything.So equating someone who is an adult, takes out a loan and signs paperwork then receives goods and services is somehow equal to slavery. 

That isn’t the stupidest comment I’ve ever read on Reddit, but is close, and I think highly disrespectful to the people who still live in slavery to this day.  You should really be ashamed of yourself.A slave is not comparable to a financially irresponsible 19 year old kid with equally financially irresponsible parents who took out large loans without any reasonable plan to pay them back.I'm not talking about a specific proposal. I'm talking about forgiving student loans. Many advocate complete forgiveness, in which case, $200k is on the low end for doctors and lawyers.

Biden's proposal is still garbage. Doctors and lawyers shouldn't be given $20k either.

I've yet to hear a logical argument for why any handout should be given to rich professionals with tremendous earning potential. It just makes absolutely no sense.It's that you, Newt? Or is it Jeb?I'd rather take loans that are repaid over straight unsecured bailouts any day. It severely lowers corruption and straight fraud. $242.5 Billion went to bail put banks. 4 years later $266.7 billion was returned to the government.

I would be more fine with PPP loans that had zero interest and were returned. Reality was billions was given in straight up fraud. In addition the immediate firing of the oversight general led to almost no oversight of the loans. And while Trump promised that he will be the oversight of the PPP loans after firing the oversight, hindsight tells us Trump was not so apt at providing oversight to prevent fraud.

Though I suppose that last part is subjective, and many folk would argue Trump firing the oversight and taking care of it himself prevented fraud.The economics term for this is Moral HazardHow would you have handled it?  
Also wasn't the point of the comment in the first place. 
Also the total amount owed in student loans is neglible when you consider how much was wasted in PPP loans and how much disappears in the DoD every single year or even by how much the US is worth in just GDP.  
This post makes it seem like almost 50% of US worth is student loans.   That's fuckin ridiculous and misleading intentionally.The 2008 crash never happened. It's coming. It's going to be a big one.No there was basically over a trillion bailout that happened right at the beginning of covid that nobody ever talks aboutThis is 2022 end of fiscal year numbers from the balance sheet.

Student loans $1342 B

https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/files/reports-statements/financial-report/2022/notes-to-the-financial-statements4.pdf

Total assets $4692 B

So it is actually 30%.

Which.....IS A FUCKING SHIT TON.

They have more student loans than cash. 

https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/reports-statements/financial-report/balance-sheets.html

Imagine taking 30% out of your bank account and giving it back to your boss. That is what forgiving student loans is.

Edit: After thinking about this for a minute I really do think that forgiveness will not happen and when it doesn't happen people that don't pay right away will go to federal prison.As I put in my comment, uni hasn’t been free in the U.K, for a very long time. 3 grand a year wasn’t bad at all, as long as you wasn’t becoming a doctor or something more specialised, which I imagine wasn’t part of the 3 grand a term rules but to then put nearly all degrees to 9-11 grand, about 10 years ago is a joke tbh. You could easily leave with 50 plus grand for a teaching degree, even more for a nursing degree as they don’t pay you to work long hours, for what the NHS classes as experience you need to the job, once your qualified.

Putting the fees up so much, was a way of keeping the poorer families from sending kids to uni and keeping the poor kids from one day becoming middle class, with a lot bigger disposable income.Not free in Canada either. Here prices are much more reasonable than they seem in the US however, likely thanks to regulations.Private trade schools sprung up all over.  Offered loans, 10K-20K.  Tuitions inflated due to ready loans.  Kids happy to go to school, misery later.Yup that’s me. If I knew then what I know now, I’d have picked up a tradeYou are focusing on the minority here.  Should be forgive all mortgages because some people lost money?Don’t forget to mention how many people are miserable sitting behind a desk 40 hours a week. Boredom leads to infidelity in relationships, addiction, depression, etc. Working a trade is fulfilling. You have a sense of accomplishment at the end of the day. Something you can touch and see.Yes. Deadbeats should do forced labor.You will no longer qualify for jobs that require that degree because you gave it back.  Apply to a job and say "TRUST ME, I know what I'm doing" and see how far that gets you.It isn't how the world CURRENTLY works because then the universities and banks would have to be more selective of who they give loans to.

It would force them to focus on a curriculum that would guarantee them a return on their investment.

It would also drive down the price of college to ensure it could be re-payed before that 4 year period expired.

I would have expected reddit of all places would be in favor of punishing and limiting corporate greed.That's a good idea.  Something like guaranteed placement with 15% front end DTI.Began in 2010. That's likely why. Not that it makes a colossal difference either way ..Maybe companies should stop giving out loans to young people that have almost no prospect of paying then off?I don't know about that. Certainly we need to do more to stop  predatory lenders from taking advantage of peopleDidn't you start looking at college and making those choices around 17 years old? Also ok you are taking advantage of 18 year old high schoolers. Is that better?birthday cutoffs vary from state to state and even from district to district, but most kids with summer birthdays graduate at 17 and some kids without summer birthdays will graduate at 17 too.Because moderators on reddit are petty censorial bitchesBecause they’re not pushing / promoting the wokey nonsense???The feds just said they are likely to raise interest rates again to slow down economic growth. To my understanding we are doing good, too good and also TMU recessions sometimes are neccesary and not a bad thing.>Federal Direct Student Loans -Education: 1,341.8 Billion

Please explain to me how this makes up 80% of our national debtNeg-am(oritizing) the loans isn't  helpful.  They're just tacking on interest for everyone.I think "thems the rules" is a bullshit reason to let a clearly predatory system run unperturbed. My point still stands. The system was set up a way and the way is the way. As you said in so many words.19 year olds can’t even buy a beer but predatory universities somehow convince them to take our tens of thousands in loans without thinking twice. Then their equally irresponsible parents cosign those loans and contribute to this shitfest.Actually while I understand your point they really made us all slaves with the 14th amendment and debt is the current weapon they are using to crush people of all races, color and creeds. Soon it will be hunger, and soon after that it will revert to the slavery we’ve all come to know as “slavery” and it will be the worst thing you can imagine.That's only half the issue. 
 
Focusing only on the TARP loans and not all the free money the banks got at the Fed discount window, and the trillions in QE printed for a decade after is misleading at best.Bret Favre closed his eyes when cashing his PPP check, so it wasn't fraud.

Also. As someone who paid cash for college tuition I'd like a reimbursement if these lazy kids get free tuition.No, the government invested in an educated public and expected to be paid back.> Imagine taking 30% out of your bank account and giving it back to your boss. That is what forgiving student loans is.

the government is not your boss - government serves to the people - government is employee



its false equivalencyIt really depends on what sort of measuring stick you're using.

Most of my friends who moved out and went to college or university have spent between 30 and 50k a year. But a much smaller fraction of that money is tuition than it is down in the USA. 

From what I've heard it really depends on whether you're going to an in-state school down there, which tend to land you in a very similar cost bracket as you'd run into up here if you were trying to pay for both your living expenses and tuition. Where things go rapidly off the rails is that the top end of colleges and universities down there are bloated and greedy money pits where you can easily flush $100k+ a year into the system to get a "better" degree.

Though admittedly, if you tried to go to a "nice" business school up here and you weren't from Canada, it would cost you a fortune too, last I checked international tuition (where the government wasn't paying 3/4 of your fare and there aren't the same regulatory controls) for a place like Sauder (UBC) was about 50k a year in tuition.No. And you shouldn’t forgive student loans. Maybe refinance them so they are no longer predatory. But I don’t believe in setting a precedent that you can incur a debt and not worry about future repercussionsEvery mortgage should be rejected since the bank takes houses away and always gets more than they did for anyone. Whoever gives up for usury feeds thisThat's not my point. I'm talking about the actual man power that goes into giving someone an education. Teachers, facilities etc. So how would getting a refund just because you didn't use it work? So all those work hours would've been free ?Interesting, I honestly appreciate this information.I hate the strict 17-18 border. Epstein got fucked because he crossed that border below 18, but we see countless examples of old rich elites taking advantage of 18 year olds.

We got the perfect example in Congress as well, Matt Gaetz. He almost got caught cause his girl was 17 part of the time, but was mostly 18 during the incident. There's no reason for the guy to be going after an 18 year old in his late 30s. And yet he's in Congress, representing the people.

Yes a middle aged man hounding barely legal girls represents the people, what does that say about us people that let this happen?If I fucked  18 year old I'd be frown apon.  I'd be told I'm taking advantage of a younger person. Manipulating them even  

But it's fine for a bank to do. 

Same vien if I wanted 100k from the bank for a business idea I'd need to prove how I could pay it back to get the loan. 

But none of these kids need to prove this degree or any degree is a smart investmentAre you trying to say they shouldn't be liable the debt?This has **fuck-all** to do with our national debt.

JFC.Can you rephrase that first word. I can't connect it to "tacking on interest" which is another concept I'm unfamiliar with concerning the Biden plan. Thanks“Predatory?”  21% interest is predatory.  Loans to pay your medical bills are predatory.

Below market loans that get be you an interest education are not predatory.19 year olds can vote.  They can serve in the military.  They can serve prison time for crimes.  And they can choose whether to borrow stupid amounts of money or not.  Fuck off with your pathetic whiningBut kids can have reassignment surgery right?>Then their equally irresponsible parents cosign those loans and contribute to this shitfest.

This is the bigger problem. The student alone wouldn't qualify for the loan. Cosigned loans should be repaid by the parents, not the students.>19 year olds can’t even buy a beer

Maybe not in the USA, but plenty of countries they can. As if it even matters. The issue is so widespread, both them and their parents have no excuse not knowing what they got themselves into when signing on that line. Plus, all the information is given to them. Simple math tells them how much and how long they will pay.No one has to take a loan.  No one.I'll add another post because I really want you to know this.


I run a small business, one location. If things go perfect I make 8k a month. Usually there's less cause of a gas leak or some other bullshit. 2017 Jobs and Tax "Cuts" raises taxes on business profits under $50,000 from 15% to 21%. Even if I make over $50k a year from my small business, I still pay more in taxes until I hit $115k after the changes in 2017.

Republicans fuck us small businesses while giving insane tax cuts for the megacirps which got insane cuts in what they paid 

I even had a mega corps insult me saying it's my fault for paying the higher taxes from 2017 cause I didn't grow my business above the limit where I would benefit from Trump's megacorp Tax Cuts.

I say fuck Trump. I was happy running my small business. I should not have to pay higher taxes just cause I'm not a mega corps. Fuck Trump's Tax ***hikes*** on small business.

Fuck him for making me pay 21% Tax rather than my previous 15%. And fuck Trump for drastically loweringvmegacorp taxes making it harder for me to compete.Sure those are valid topics, but the person I responded to specifically mentioned bank bailouts. And those did earn profit for the government and since they had to be paid back were not as fraud written as other such mechanisms.

Quantitative easing is a whole other beast. It involves the US buying it's own bonds to raise bond prices and thus keep interest rates low.

The Federal reserve keeping interest rates low is half the reason we are in today's problem. And why the Fed needs to raise interests rates so fast.

If the Fed was actually impartial it would have started raising interest rates much sooner and prevented the mess of today.

Edit: this also brings up a whole different beast. This topic really needs like a multi book response.

The current tax code rewards companies for not keeping **any** cash on hand. You know how individuals are punished for not saving for hard times? Well the tax code literally punishes companies for keeping cash on hand.

This is what led to the bailouts. In conforming to the spirit of capitalism companies kept no savings, and thus in hard times had no savings like individuals are expected.

And since they were deemed too big to fail they were bailed out. Our corp tax code is a complete failure.

And it dosen't take much to see why. Just look at literally the last tax cuts. The 2017 Jobs and Tax Cuts Act cut large corporation taxes by a third, while raising taxes on small business.


The tax reforms did nothing to fix large corporations and instead let them become even more corrupt, while punishing small business for who knows why the Republican party wants to hamper small business.

Couple this with the weird republican tax policy that led to the "25 cent executive". Where dividends and stock options ate more important then profit.

This leads to abominations like Uber. Where Uber has never made a profit **ever**. But growth is the primary focus. And that leads to higher dividends and more executive stock options. Who needs normal income which is taxed?

Now join this with the 2017 Trump tax hikes on small business. How is a small company suppose to deal with Trump tax hikes while dealing with corporations not even worrying about making a profitmRead it yourself. All told there has been a 2.5 trillion bailout for over leveraged hedge funds and massive corporations facing insolvency. In March of 2020 the federal government started buying up corporate debt which is unprecedented. You just didn’t hear about it.

https://theintercept.com/2020/05/27/federal-reserve-corporate-debt-coronavirus/or maybe the gov went into business handing out loans to 18 year olds but really handing money to 5 thousand shady "schools" formed in response to the "loans" and 700 previously non-shady institutions that raised tuition in a corrupted market and it's a win-win-LOSE.   
Millions of lame degrees and under-educated kids working at Wendy's.  $1.3T  on the books!   Winners and losers.I'm not trying to get political on my posts here.

30% is a lot. 

But yes, it is on their balance sheet that they expect to be paid back. If they write it off (which they would have to do with forgiveness) they will have to lower their cash. This would be bad (harder to pay bills) so insurance companies and banks would raise rates which would make everybody pay more in taxes.The government doesn't produce or pay for anything. They have a monopoly on force and tax you to pay for it. They don't need to be paid back, they're being paid to rob you as-is, while also taxing you for that "privilege".Your idealism and naivete is adorable 😂😂😂Neg amming? It just doesn't type well.really? Because if a 20 year old kid went to the bank today and asked to borrow $20k to start a business with a plan how he would use that $ to generate more and pay it back, they would tell him to go find a mcdonald’s job applicantion.

But some 18 year old assfuck goes and says he wants to study sociology, plans for the future include “idk maybe ill do a masters or something” he gets $50k thrown at him.Did he say that? If not then wtf does this have to do with anything? Also what kids can have reassignment surgery? There are exactly 0 minors who've had legal reassignment.How often do you think that actually happens?Exactly. And I understand why people might first downvote what you’re saying but I would encourage people to think through it again.

These are contracts and your consent is giving them authority over you.

We all have been contracting with an enemy that literally is poisoning us to death and is doing everything it can to extract what it can from our good years and toss the rest aside when they’ve had their fill.

For those who would still like to contract with an honest bank they are out there but they are few.

Catherine Austin Fitts has some good information online about how to find an “honest” bank. Questions to ask and what to look for.

Stop supporting your enemy with your dollars.Same with personal tax.   
Fake 2 year rates that climbed after that.  I hang with low-income folks and they always looked forward to tax day.  (cause refunds)  No more.  Gone.  Everybody got a huge bill.>Republicans fuck us small businesses while giving insane tax cuts for the megacirps which got insane cuts in what they paid

That's how the entire government works, friend. Both sides exist solely to fuck you, while making you think it's just the other team. They both want you broke and dead, and they'll charge/tax you for both.$115k isn't a Mega Corp. Ha.  They probably just want to weed out scams and scammer businesses with a low limit like that. 
 
And if your tax went from 15% to 21% on 50k you are literally bitching about $3,000 before deductions.  Zzzzz.  I even doubt this story since you should be a sole proprietorship and they are usually unaffected by corporate tax rate changes.> Millions of lame degrees and under-educated kids working at Wendy's. 

It's a scam.This, student loans aren't meant to be paid back, just like the federal debt of $30+trillion, and the countless state, municipal and corporate debt. It's meant to be rolled over and refinanced or inflated away.Yeah, in my experience the checks are not written to the kids.  They go direct to the schools. "negative amortization" loans, for those reading along.That’s because the government underwrites them.  Didn’t use to be that way.  Don’t like it? Blame the government.YES! And loans that are made unwisely often are just written off. Student loans are protected from bankruptcy, forgiving the balance on the gov's dime doesn't do shit to solve the problem of bad loans.Someone bought the beer for them, that might have contributed to the student loan mistake that came later, bud light!If you are 19 and can’t find a way to get beer and more, you are less resourceful than most high school sophomores.What does slavery have to do with student loans? Lmao if that dude can introduce stupid shit to the conversation then I can too. :) you can reassignment surgery at 17 and 15 in some countries. So why can a little boy chop his dick off but can’t sign up for a student loan?

A link from AP discussing this since I know you will ask for a source(but won’t read it) https://apnews.com/article/gender-transition-treatment-guidelines-9dbe54f670a3a0f5f2831c2bf14f9bbb>There are exactly 0 minors who've had legal reassignment.

5 seconds spent on a Google search says that's a lie.Doesn’t matter how often it happens, my point is that it can happen and we’re all “okay” with it. But that same kid can’t sign a loan document?Shit I must be part of the non-low-income folks, I got a good amount-ishPeople incorporate small businesses for the liability protection, I know because this is what my wife and two of my best friends did. The smallest startup home businesses got a tax increase under Trump.

Having a flat tax rate instead of graduated brackets massively increases the dominance of larger existing mega corporations. You wonder why competition is dead in America, it’s tax policy like the TCJA.

Edit: Small businesses also feel the burden of inflation far more the large businesses. This inflation is largely caused by government borrowing to fund these tax cuts for the wealthy and established.Yep and now you have a massive population of college graduates who are shackled by loans which they should have never taken. Everyone is responsible, including them and their parents. But universities and banks acted predatory in this.I'm arguing that the deal, the general rule, is based on a corrupt system from the start. A runaway slave is a criminal. A person suffering from payments due to a corrupt system is  still a delinquent when he misses some. 

Then you guys somehow don't understand the analogy. I never said student debt is like slavery. I forgot you guys are fake literal.I mean it sort of does. there are \~45 million people with student loan debt. Per a quick search there are something like 250 gender surgeries on minors a year. Meanwhile there are thousands of minors shot a year. Your whataboutism pivot to reassignment surgery isnt even remotely comparable and isnt a real issue.So you own a small business but have to refer to your wife and friend for their experience on tax matters and not your own business?  Yeah, that makes a ton of sense ha.  Not buying anything you are selling.  
 
Doesn't even seem like you known what a sole proprietorship is and you claim to own one?  Ha.“shackled by loans.”   If you went to college and can’t monetize that, why argue that people who didn’t should shoulder the expense?>But universities and banks acted predatory in this.

Universities and government; before the government took over the entire student loan industry, the banks would have been happy to reject student loan applications but for government regulations requiring the banks to approve the loans.I was simply pointing out that we let kids choose other life changing decisions and it’s not a big deal but it’s too hard for the little underdeveloped brains of teenagers to understand how loans work? If kids can’t choose to take loans and “ruin” their life’s until they are older why can they decide to have irreversible surgeries? I get it’s the hip fad to be a white knight for the poor trans people but step into reality and see that people that take loans have a responsibility to repay those.I think you’re confused as to who you’re talking to. It’s not my business, it’s my wife’s business. I’m just confirming what the other guy is saying. 

The TCJA tax changes are public, you can see the lowest brackets increased and the highest decreased to create a flat tax rate which greatly benefits larger more profitable corporations over smaller start up ones.I was drunk yesturday so went on a bit of a rant with bad spelling. But yes I did it for the liability protection. I own a local gym, not franchised if you must know. Liability protection is a must. 

$115k isn't a megacorp, but about $115k is when I would actually start benefiting from the tax changes rather than paying more. The old tax rates used to be progressive.

Add onto that large megacorps in the millions of profit got major tax cuts. This makes it even harder for me to compete against them. They also have benefits of scale.

I realize 8k(in a flawless month) isn't much in big business standards, but I get by just fine. I live a pretty minimalistic lifestyle and thus have money for fun.I just wanted to add. I get it. Republicans think that us small businesses owners are a blight. I get it that you think if I don't do like Teynp wiith his 140 S corps and 400+ shell companies I'm a failure.

And I do agree with you that I don't do as much as the ultra rich elite in furthering the nation.

I simply provide local folks an option to work out when a megacorp dosen"t see mega profit in the area.

So yeah I totally agree with you I'm not that beneficial.

But please see the plight of us small business owners. We do get shafted by Republicans over and over and yes we only provide value locally. But please see that we are humans, and just cause we aren't ultra elite deserving ever increasing tax breaks we are humans, and we deserve to live as anyone else.

And I totally get it that if the rich didn't get these tax breaks, they wouldn't have so much money to spend  on investments.

Which would mean house prices wouldn't be so astronomical and thus the rich wouldn't be able to retire with ever increasing wealth from rising renting prices.

So I do understand you.

But I hope you can understand us small business owners aswell. Especially those of us who don't have ever increasing wealth from housing investments and insane rent prices.I didnt argue that. I said people who legitimately dont have a plan on how they will use their education to generate wealth should not have bags of money thrown at them, because it creates a national crisis. 

I graduated university with 0 loans. Im not one of the people who contributed to this. But thousands of gullible students and irresponsible parents are responsible and again it is creating a big problem that now the entire national is going to shoulder. 

And again, universities/banks acted predatory. They threw bays of money at clueless students who had no odea what they are doing.Lower middle-class kid:  "I can't go to college, nobody in my family ever went to college"  
College:  I got you.  Sign here.I reject that premise.  Sorry - but education is only a liability if you don’t use it.  If you don’t that isn’t the fault of the bank or other taxpayers. 

I do think that the price of education went up way too much when government got involved - and there is a lesson in that.You dont think its the fault of the bank when they just throw unforgivable loans at 18 year old kids?

If a 19 year old went to a plan with a business plan that’s perfectly laid out and thought through, they would say “we will not even give him $20, he is too young and the risk that he wont pay is too high”

Then comes along 19 year old who put no more than 2 mins thought into being a sociologist and he gets $50k thrown at him

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/conspiracy) if you have any questions or concerns.*Because everyone is taking money from the Saudis and not just the GOP.I got this one: Because they actually don't.There’s a difference between earning money because you know how to conduct business and making money from bribes simply because you are the coked out son of an American politician with zero experience in the energy production industry. That’s why.This so much. People ready to riot over chump change, Hunter getting like $40k a month for sitting on some board or a claim that 7 “Bidens” split $1m dollars from China.

Meanwhile we have extremely public information that Jared Kushner’s fledgling investment firm was given $2b from the Saudi Price (against his advisors recommendations) and no one wants to look into that? Khashoggi? Soleimani? Top secret documents on Iran? This is the conspiracy we should really be talking about.GOP:  "well, you see.  Fuck you.  That's why!"Because they have nothing else. They have no policy platform. They can't even use abortion anymore. It is the same reason they are targeting trans people suddenly.You're right! Throw ALL of them in prison!! And while we're at it, let's get the Bush's, the Clinton's, the Obama's, the Pelosi's, and just about every living politician that has ever set foot in DC. And news flash buddy, our government has been giving money to the Saudi's since the creation of the petrodollar. The fact is, Biden is a SITTING PRESIDENT and is actively taking bribes, selling us out to the Chinese, and utterly terrorizing his constituents. At least under Trump, things were going good. Biden has fucked this country ten ways til Tuesday and to deny that would be ridiculous.The Saudis invested in an investment company that Kushner is part of.  It wasn’t a gift.  Kushner didn’t get to take it home or spend it on hookers and blow like Hunter did.Because they let trump set their agendaBingo. At this point I can’t believe anyone still believes in the GOP or Democratic Party. Both cover up crimesLol taking 2 billion from a dictatorship who murdered a dismembered a journalist is just as bad and likely worse than taking bribes and having a coked out son.Please do elaborate, what exactly has Biden done that’s fucked the country?A fledgling investment company founded by Kushner in 2021. $2b is shit ton of money to just hand over to someone, especially someone with absolutely no experience. The Crown Prince’s advisors also advised against it citing Kushner’s inexperience.

Kushner has full control over that $2b to invest however he sees fit and collects a cool $40m+/year in fees to take home and spend on hookers and blow.

I don’t know if there is anything here but it sure seems far more suspicious then Hunter sitting on some board of directors for a few hundred thousand a year (this is extremely common).

Edit: Also Madoff, SBF, Holmes and hundreds of others would disagree about Kushner’s inability to use that entire $2b on hookers and blow.Exactly. I have a hard time believing people still think one side is better than the other. I guess we can blame the smith Mundt act revision. Back in the day when the news agencies were wrong about a story the would have to go on air and correct it. When was the last time you saw that?It's literally the two Spider man pointing at each other, but one of our last presidents really tipped the scales hard in one direction.Kushner was an investment banker before Trump ever took office - and doing well.

Hunter was a crack addict with no experience in the energy business.

See a difference here?  If not you must work for the mass media.Yeah, dead serious. I keep hearing this repeated but we have record jobs numbers. Record growth. We’re avoiding a recession. Inflation is a global issue one we’ve stayed on the low side of and is cooling. We have a great much needed infrastructure plan. If the Supreme court doesn’t fuck us we’ll have some debt relief for students this month. Covid is gone. Restrictions are gone.

So yes, please do elaborate on what exactly Biden has done that is so bad.Kushner was a real estate investor with daddy’s money, not an investment banker.

Hunter has a BA and JD from Yale with over a decade of work experience as a legal consultant. 

Both of their “success” is straight nepotism. Do you not understand the difference between a $2b angel investment and a few hundred thousand run of mill nepotism hire?I think it's pretty telling that nobody has named anything specific.I regret getting the COVID vaccine.I got the vaccine a few years ago because my parents decided the whole family should, but now when I think about it, it is very suspicious and I 100% regret getting it (they were fear mongered by the media). Now I'm scared there are going to be some long-term effects because of it (infertility) or other issues. I don't know if I'm going crazy but I have never felt so much regret in my life.###[Meta] Sticky Comment

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/conspiracy) if you have any questions or concerns.*Can't undo it now. No sense stressing. What will happen, will happen.Now this isn't a conspiracy it's a testimonialI was forced to get it for work (and by extension keep my house). When I signed the papers, I put 'coerced procedure' as my little FU, in hopes that history will show what a sham it was. 

I'm not anti-vaccine whatsoever, I whole heartedly think that they are objectively good. With that said, my childhood best friend is a corporate executive for a major pharmaceutical company, and from my understanding, they were all advised not to take it. Additionally, my FAMILY DOCTOR told me (before HE DIED 3 weeks later) -  that he's seeing a lot of side effects from it, and if he knew then what he knows now, he wouldn't advise people to get it. 

So ya. Needless to say, people get mad and/or call me a liar when I tell them my COVID vaccine anecdotes.No sense of stressing yourself out.  You made the decision and I'm sure your heart and intentions were in the right place with it.

You didn't need to take the vax in order to be subjected to the possibility of infertility.  There have been issues for many, at least in the West, regarding fertility, long before the vax hit the scene.

If you don't already have a faith-based system, adopt one or create your own.  We all need something to give our worries to in this trying time.

In the end, stay righteous, and you'll at least win half of the battle.  You win the other half by taking action.  Best of luck.I really wouldn't worry about it too much, granted I say that as someone without it. I'm in the camp of saying it was just the test for something more sinister. It's good that you feel it wasn't right.No point in regret, You can still make up for it i believe. Don't allow yourself to become complacent or you will continue giving away your Human liberties.You can live your life with purpose. 

 There is some movie where something terrible happens to a person and the villain or the hero is standing in the room watching this person cry and they just say use it.



Not trying to diminish your experience or another's. There's people who were cut off from their family who lost everything. Some of them just for not taking the JAB. They didn't say anything or attack anyone. Nor threaten taking someone's healthcare, job or child they just wanted it be. 

 You might have more means where they no longer do, unite with them build a coalition of unity.I didint have taken any loans, I dont do that... I was forced to quit my work, I did... started to live alone in woods in trailer. all the money I saved to that point invested on my own business I allways wanted to start... and now I work for myself. better than any job I ever had before, and pay is different and there is no stress... not taking vax actually helped me to kickstart what I allways fearedMany people are forced to get a vaccine so that they don't get infected with COVID, but I also think that it might affect my health in the future, so it's scary.I wouldn't take the vax for a million free hamburgers+fries OR donuts.5.5 billion people are vaccinated. You have nothing to fear.Hundreds of millions were given out. Freaking out about it now is just paranoia and ignorance/scientific illiteracy.Just deal with it and try to live healthier. Thinking you're gonna drop dead any second because of anti-vaxx mf on twitter was blabbering about it doesnt mean anything's gonna happen. Fearmongering goes both way. Don't fall for either.You already have it. Nothing you can do. Move on and live your best life.You are a strong healthy person. You'll be fine. Over the years I bet you'll have bigger regrets. I know I do. Ugh.Op's profile looks so dumb I believe it's fake, meanwhile there are chills claiming the experimental injection was no big deal.Currently almost a million on the table for a Pro vaccine debaterThere must be so many other people that will also be deeply regretful.TBH this bullshit about everyone from cops,to doctors,to peoples jobs forcing them to take this graphene poison is just plain wrong.Then when they get horrible side effects they turn the blame saying ''sorry but you took the shot'' we dont want any liability when the politicians know exactly how dangerous it is.Its only after hours of research and truth that ive discovered how totally f'kd up all of this actually is.Most people sadly are ignorant and some people just cant handle the truth because its overwhelming.These are some of the worst crimes in humanity since the 2nd world war.Thats not an exaggeration.Did you just get the one shot?I doubt  side effects will start to arise two years after getting the vaccine. It's just that your vaccine is completely useless at stopping COVID. (In fact, it actually has negative effectiveness, or increases the odds of catching COVID.)The vaccine isn’t even in your system anymore so I don’t even understand this post.The FLCCC Alliance have published a comprehensive post-vax treatment protocol:

https://covid19criticalcare.com/protocol/i-recover-post-vaccine-treatment/

Please upvote for visibility.Not a single person that didn’t get it regret their decision. The people who did take it on the other handThe vaccines have been out for years now. Billions of doses have been given, with tens of thousands of studies conducted, and in that time, scientific consensus has overwhelmingly concluded that the vaccine is safe with the handful of major side effects being both exceedingly rare and only observed in the first few weeks after vaccination.

There is no mechanism by which long term side effects could occur. There is no evidence suggesting it can cause fertility issues. And the idea that, years down the line, you'd have to worry about some unspecified harm is effectively just ignorant.Don’t be worried. I don’t think it was necessary to get for most people but it clearly doesn’t cause any long term issues for the vast majority of people who get it.I regret it. I have tinnitus now because of itJust educate others and spread awarenessThere've been no scientific reports of Covid vaccine causing a side effect that didn't occur soon after the injection.  And infertility is a lie. There have probably been hundreds of thousands of people giving birth after getting the shots and no increase in reports of infertility. 
If you begin believing in unscientific alt-right propaganda, being spread for political purposes, then you are worrying (and perhaps blaming your parents) for no good reason.I also regret getting the jab, and the more I read and hear about it, the more I regret it.
I'm healthy, exercise daily, try and eat well. That's the best I can do.Does anyone have any good websites for information on cleansing the body after getting the vaccine?I thought it was crazy that there were covid vax cards and you couldn’t go into arena or certain places without it. I only ever had to show it once and it was for some stupid sports game.What are the facts? Because pro vaxxers always saying men in white coats are always rightN Acetyl Cysteine is supposed to help detox the body, cilantro is also great for heavy metal detox. Most important though is a relationship with Jesus Christ of Nazareth, the only thing that matters in this life ultimately.im sure some of the jabs were placebos, hopefully yours was a dudYou should regret it. If you would have used common sense and critical thinking, you would have realized it wasn't a good thing. Good luck in the future with your healthYou'll be fine, just read some information from actual doctors and stay away from conspiracy boards for a while.Don’t beat yourself up about it, just try to recognize the herd mentality on the next psy-op they try to pull and don’t fall for it.A lot of people were pointing out the immediate reactions to covid (or what they thought were reactions) but I always thought it was the long-term consequences that was the most important.

They said this was targeting DNA, which means it is likely something meant to develop over the course of generations- likely two to three.I think some just got saline solution.During the tyranny of the Biden administration, I constantly had to comfort my wife and children reassuring them, comforting them, allaying their fears of the future to come and the long term effects from the power grabs by the State and corporations, the trampling of our Constitution as we watched a world wide conspiracy unfold in real time across the entirety of the western world. 

I bet you were sitting smug & comfortable in your compliance, weren't you? 

I'm glad you have regret and fear. By complying with the State and corporations, you've helped to erode all of our rights to bodily autonomy, our civil rights, our lives, our happiness and our liberties. 

Next time, try not to roll right over, k?Fast. Water fasting can help you detoxThat Vax was so rushed I trust other vaccines but something about this one disturbed me.Aw dang man I'm so sorry...according to this sub you can die suddenly anytime between last night and 25 years from now...my apologies..You'll he fine. Just remember millions of people have taken this jab and are fine.The shitty thing with this mindset is that at this point no matter what you end up developing you’re gonna blame the vaccine and nothing else.had to get it for work, now i’m constantly short of breath, and my heart beats funny. my mom got it and developed huge blood clots in her lungs.I regret not trying harder to talk my now vax-debilitated dad out of it.You’re fine and you should recognize that there is fear mongering on both sides of this debate. The odds of you having any long term side effects are extremely low and your stress from the fear mongering is probably much worse for yourselfOne parent recently had quad bypass after heart attack, survived. Heathy person but had two phizer shots, other parent has a small mass getting checked out.. They had one shot Astra..

My family members buddy had two phizer and dropped dead in front of other friends no warning, this was 3 months before my parents heart attack.


My book keepers mother had moderna 1shot and she had something that fked up how she walked, just getting better after 2years.

These vacs seem more like a death clock that trigger randomly.You know, I never thought of the blood transfusions. If a person never got the vaccination and then was in an accident need a blood transfusion they’re screwed.I am so sorry that you were tricked into getting the jab. There are a lot of things on the internet that people are posting on how to detox your body and get rid of the negative things that they put into those shots. I will also be praying for you ❤️This is the kind of story that redirects peoples lives completely. May this major regret fuel the fire that motivates action. Tear down the system that has torn youAfter that latest JRE episode I'm convinced 80% of the vaccines are just money grabs and very bad for you. I'm glad I stood my ground with my company and didn't get the jab. Just kept putting in religious exemptions.You are not crazy. Nobody knows the extent of the issues that will be caused by the vaccine, but I've heard a ton of awful stuff including death.

I personally have not been vaccinated and I also have not gotten COVID. Knock on wood, I've wondered if I was immune.Man I just got my first job out of school. Boss was an old right winger and did get the vaxx. Explained to me how I sadly had to get the vaccine as we worked in hospitals. I told him my reasons not to. I ended up quitting haha but on my last day, a guy from a big design firm in Michigan said “hey take your COVID preparedness plan out of your proposal. We think that’s behind us.”  

I’m so lucky I quit that job and I remain vaxx free. 3 years!! Bartending at the busiest bar in my city. COVID may be real but the way the media and governments tried to control us was unreal.If you don’t have symptoms now you should be fine. Vax injured people like me and others developed symptoms within weeks of injection, and are slowly recovering.

Usual symptoms now two years later are autoimmune issues, tinnitus, digestive issues, neurological issues, and heart issues.There are no long term effects. Every vaccination EVER has shown side effects within 2 months. Your safe but have been watching too much Fox News (hint: it’s not a real news station). You’ll be fine.You’ll be fine. Like the billions of other people who took the vaccine. 

Don’t let weirdos scare you, you did the right thing for the health of yourself and your family."I've never felt so much regret in my life" boy you must be 12Most of the vials were placebo imo, maybe 5% were actually the real thing poisoning peopleYou should be. You should look into detoxing protocols to see if they can help you. 

Sorry that you didn't have the inner temerity understand the predicament you were in at the time. 

I would get over it once you have fully explored the topic. 

Just leave and be healthyGuys so I was thinking thats its possible I only got the saline solution. I believe this because when I got it, I had zero side effects other than tenderness in the area of injection, but my dad had a very rough few nights. What do you think?Literally billions of jabs have been given with few side effects. The side effects from COVID or multiple COVID infections without the jab leaves you vulnerable to death or disability. 10,000 people a year die from aspirin. Nothing is ever 100% safe.clean your system

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0Kix7WdEUE&t=1127sMy mom got it and now has the same worries. While it definitely didn’t do you any favors lol, it’s not worth worrying about. I get really bad health anxiety and I pretty chronically worry about stupid little things like this. Trust me, it’s just a waste of mental energy. What’s done is done, you just need to make peace with it and not think about it. I needed to get a couple of CT scans on my head and I was freaked out for weeks about getting brain cancer in 10 years from the radiation. I worried myself sick but eventually I realized there’s nothing I can do. It’s already done and whatever is gonna happen is gonna happen. If I could go back in time I wouldn’t have done it, but it’s too late now.

I’m sorry they scared you and your family into taking the shot. They are so effing evil it makes me sick.if it makes you feel better i got pregnant 7 months after i got the vaccine and i now have a healthy baby and had a healthy pregnancySo you got it, and so far nothing bad has happened, yet you're scared it will, but your family were the ones who got 'fear mongered'? Right....

Literally billions of people have had the vaccine. Chill, bro.If you are worried that much, go see a homeopath, many have a vaccine detox protocol nowadays.It's hugely unlikely you're going to drop down dead. If you stress yourself out though, you really will become ill and it'll be a self -fulfilling prophecy. Any of us could die at any time if we are realistic, just enjoy life and stop worrying.Me too. I got my, essentially forced, two by September of 2021. Starting in May/June of 2022, ~7 months after the shots, I developed heart palpitations. I've gone to the hospital several times and they've even done a holter, but apparently everything is normal according to them. I've massively cut salt and fats, started wearing compression socks, increased my water intake ALOT, and I do calm/relaxing stretching, all of which have definitely decreased the severity of them, but they still happen. 

I am also 17 weeks pregnant and my vaccine site in my arm BURNS, it feels like when I first got the shots. It's been burning since I was ~6 weeks pregnant. There also seems to be a small lump right in the area I got the shots and if I rub it, the burning intensifies immensely. Thankfully, it doesn't seem to be traveling or growing, so I'm trying not to worry too deeply about it.It was a no-win situation. You had things to lose by taking it, or not taking it. That's how they do these things. Heads I win, tails you lose.I had covid, so i took the vaccine bc i didnt want it again. So not sure which is messing with my health.I regret it also. It also didn’t help and I had to get it for my job.its good they made sure dumb people have less chance to reproduceI was forced to get it being military.  I regret it, but I kept my job and kept the rest of my family jab free.There are supposedly ways to detox some of it from your body. I don't remember the details but it will take diligent research and dedication.You can take chelating agents to help remove the heavy metals from "normal" Vs, but this one is a whole different beast. Best to go mind over matter on this one and go on with your life and not worry about potential injuries.Do you have issues currently? What future effects concern you?Don’t regret it, you and your family did what you thought was right at the time. Hindsight is 20/20 right? Someone was bound to take it and now we have data on their efficacy. It sucks you were an experiment, but all life is really an experiment after all. If the vaccines didn’t give you infertility the plastic and pharmaceuticals in the water would have.Fuck all vaccines we don't need em. We apparently evolved from monkeys and have Eaton every single thing under the sun but now after all those millions of years being okay we suddenly need some pharmaceutical company to force vaccines on us. It's a capitalist scam.Out of the blue the other day a colleague of mine who got the vaccine randomly commented on how I hadn't and told me my sermon was probably worth a lotI know a few people who now have autoimmune issues, heart issues, etc mysteriously after getting the Spike protein injectables.  I also strangely know a few people who still think that the injectables were effective. The last two years was a horrible stain on our history and people will deny any negative effects for the rest of their lives.Personally i don’t think anything will come of it. You should worry more about your diet,do you live a healthy lifestyle?

if you are not actively taking care of your body i would worry about that wayyy before thinking the vaccine is going to haunt you x years from now.The biggest cancer causer is stress so just lock this incident away like an assault and just live your best life.

TBH:  we all have the vaxx in one way or another regarding side effects and fertility issues.

Shedding.  It’s real and we all have some aspects of the vaxx and it’s mostly reproductive.  I read something a couple of years ago explaining that yes, in fact the vaxx was made to spread.  The government knew everybody wouldn’t get it. That’s why it’s being injected into meat.  We are eating the vaccine I mean…  how do we avoid any of this?

Please don’t worry about things we can’t change.

I’m sorry for you ,too. 
My vaxxed cousin just had a baby. It’s normal, if that helps. (It is a little weirdly advanced).There are detox protocols on the internetI was pretty much guilt tripped every day by my family for months into getting it. What finally made me get it was the bonus offered through my work on top of all the guilt tripping. 


I figured I’m young and healthy, so if there’s side effects it won’t hurt me as bad. The only thing I’ve noticed is my heart area hurts more during physical exercise but I don’t know if that’s because I’m getting older or because I’ve gotten fatter since then.I didn’t get it but if I were you I wouldn’t spend one second worrying about it. 1. It’ll do you no good. The best thing you can do is live a healthy, happy life free from stress. And 2. Nobody knows if these shots are bad or not. We’re all in the dark. 

In all likelihood you’re going to be absolutely fine. Live your best life and don’t sweat the small stuff.its not like nobody warned you. RIGHT???The biggest regret of my life was “trusting the science” not necessarily for me - i’m already old, but because I also took my kids to get vaccinated.I have a fake card. I was treated better at a show for being up to date vs my friend who was treated like dirt for not having 1 booster. It’s hilarious since he believed in the vaccines And was still treated poorly compared to the “anti vaccine” conspiracy theorist. It was a good lesson.Even though I was in the military, I was essentially forced to get the vaccine or face expulsion and lose my livelihood. However, while in the desert, the doctor informed us that J&J was the most effective option out of the three mentioned. She explained that it genetically modifies the body to combat Covid. At that moment, we all promptly disagreed and walked away. But a few months later, they began enforcing mandatory vaccinations, leaving me no choice but to actively search for J&J. It seemed like they were phasing it out, and now I don't even hear about it anymore. Ultimately, I'm relieved that I chose J&J because my grandparents and my best friend, who received the triple Moderna, experienced blood clots. Sadly, my best friend is being discharged due to medical reasons related to the vaccine. It still angers me to this day that our right to choose was taken away, and it doesn't sit well with me. I suspected something was wrong from the beginning, and I would have never taken that foolish shot if I had a real choice that wouldn't impact my career. Now, suddenly, it has been rescinded and we are no longer required to get it, but it's too late, nearly a year has passed.I mean I got my girl pregnant after I got the vaccine. None of us 3 have gotten anything abnormal I think you’ll be good26 months of issues here man, I’m at 90% after hitting 40%. There’s no way to give a short version of what I’ve experienced. 

I’m 24M, LISTEN TO YOUR INTUITION!!!!! I ignored mine and now my life is a mess.Just chill. It’s the best thing for you. All you’ve got is this moment anyways.Fear mongering from one side led you to getting the vaccine and now fear mongering from the opposite side is making your regret it. Maybe you should stop worrying so much and step away from your devices for a moment. Go outside or something.Trump took the vaccine. That’s all I needed to know about its effectiveness, he’s a germaphobe and he still took it.I’ve noticed a lot of people are now regretting getting the COVID vaccine how interestingLook into clay, Eason salt, detox baths. You get the bath water as hot as you can and you add the ingredients. It detoxes micro bots….https://www.howbadismybatch.comYou’re not gonna be infertile lolGood for you for coming forth with feeling you made a mistake rather than doubling down !So do my friends, one is absolutely crappin herself with the thought of what went in her.I don’t regret getting it, I don’t care that it “might” have made me infertile, I don’t want kids, never have, never will. I’m not concerned with any long term health issues either, we take that risk with everything Health/medicine related.   


However after we were repeatedly being told that it would grant immunity, then catching it a few months after my second booster and getting horribly sick with side effects on the second & third booster, I’m assuming they lied about the immunity and if I’m called for a fourth booster, I’m going to refuse. I’ve had it, I know I have antibodies, I had the blood test done. I see no reason to get the fourth, three is plenty.   


regarding the vaccine itself, both my parents refused outright. Both caught it (not from me, they had it beforehand) and were horribly sick, my father was hospitalised with it and still suffers to this day with chest issues. I came down with severe fatigue and was left with chronic migraine and light sensitivity. I dread to think how bad it would have been if I didn’t take it.You can undo the damage caused by the vaccine by living a healthy life!

&#x200B;

Boost your imune system to the max, be more in nature, do NOT eat processed foods, etc...

&#x200B;

you'll be fineAren't your fears part of that fear mongering as well?Hope you got the saline shot and not the clot shot.STFU with this nonsense.

&#x200B;

\*Edit\*  looking through your history, it seems like you are a hypochondriac. You need to close the computer, live your life, and quit worrying about everything.Just wait until people learn the mRNA vaccine has been added to meat & produce. I hear that drinking pine needle tea helps.guys so hear me out after I got the vaccine (not directly after like a year later) I remember I got sick and my smell was messed up for a few days. this is a symptom of covid. so if I contracted covid after the vaccine, is it possible it was just saline?Can’t trust your own family anymore? That just sucks.I had a lot of side effects from the J&J one, and never got a booster because of it. Dizzy, black spots in vision, confusion, and a crazy circular rash that started a couple of weeks later that has spread to most of my torso and face.Look ignore the comments saying you took it now deal with it. 
Its true but this is a lesson for you, you made the choice, you let yourself become pressured into it.

How old were you when you took this please?? Because you wrote it like you were a kid when it happened and tbh this needs to be clear here.

You regret it sure but OWN up to the fact that it was your choice and that YOU will NEVER EVER let ANYONE tell you what to take again and THAT YOU will use YOUR OWN judgment and research in the future. PROMISE yourself this to alivate this regret!!!

Don't be scared, don't panic and be calm. Simply keep reading and looking because I few people have mentioned stuff you may take to counter it as best as you can or simple have faith in the higher power to protect you, literally.

Research into what you took and go from there!!! Acually move your brain and do something and believe me this will help!!!! Don't please drown in your regrets. Learn from your mistake, move on thats how you feel better  and best of luck xxDude chill. You're getting fear mongered by the inverse side of this issue now.A cell phone is what one should really be concerned about it’s psychologicalI know plenty of people who got the vaccine and had kids or are pregnant now.I got the vaccine and a booster. My girlfriend did too. We’re both fine. She got pregnant in November 2021, about 6ish months after we both got the original vaccine. You’re fine.Lots of pro vax bots in this thread. Sad some still believe they made the right decision to inject poison inside their bodies. Sad people believe their health hasn’t been effect because they “are still alive” now… OP look into covid vax detox. There are some ways to cleanse your body of all the toxins brought by those “vaxs.”N- acetylcysteine, bromelaine,  nattokinase and intermittent fasting are supposed to help detox...Look up the documentary called "died suddenly" it's on rumble... Sorry that you had to go through with that. Hope you all stay well- namasteNo one forced any of you people your just weak willedhttps://covid19criticalcare.com/protocol/i-recover-post-vaccine-treatment/I truly believe that there were a ton of placebo shots given out (they need a control group remember) and low dose shots. I do think there were many varied doses because again, this was all one big experiment and they couldn't have everyone dropping like flies, they needed people to get the shots and walk around saying, "See?!! I got he shot and nothing happened to meeeeee" so others would feel comfortable getting them too. I think there were some "kill" shots in the bunch and I think a lot of boosters were kill shots and these people have already died or will experience side effects now and in the future. So if you haven't had any side effects yet and you haven't got a booster I would just try to remain positive and hope that you were one of the lucky ones that got one of the "good" shots.You should not be ashamed of taking it, you tried to do the right thing. I'm not fully against vaccines but something was just off with the Covid situation just like with Swine flu in 2010. The way they tried to push people getting vaccinated turned me off.

I got lucky I was working from home all the time and wasn't required taking it. I even haven't catch Covid. There are some nasty people in charge that are consciously not themselves.Remember when you all said millions of us would die from heart clots and less that the standard rate did? Yeah, I remember…This is bait to spark vaccine vs anti vaccine debates.

The real topic is all the money/perceived power being siphoned to parasitical beings who enjoy seeing us divided :-)Don’t worry too much about your fertility, I know a few people that have gotten pregnant with no issues this year.
Despite all the people vaccinated, that birth and population clock hasn’t slowed at all

https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/

https://www.census.gov/popclock/its ok man. pray for cleansing of your body and  dont take any moreYou should feel regret. Knowing you feel regret means you aren't a fucking robot who bootlicks it's way through its existence.Take your lame parents to courtI feel exactly the same my worry is that with the increase in population around the world, that it is away of stopping people ageing too much. Alot of old people died after taking the jab, and it's strange that it was only mandatory for adults to take the jab.

I took the jab and I've not felt the same since like my immune system is weaker than what it was. 

Before my jabs I was hardly ever ill. Since I have been I'll quite a lot. 

I regret taking it.If it makes you feel better, I got the COVID vaccine, and then 6 weeks after that I got my girlfriend pregnant, and now my boy is here and he is a happy & healthy baby. I understand where you’re coming from though, I had those same fears and regrets after getting the vaccine.Please don't judge yourself. Were all in this together nowDon't worry. Vaccines are safe. Nothing is perfectly safe, but vaccines are very, very safe. 

What you've heard about vaccines isn't correct. It doesn't come from people who have expertise in the field of medicine, biology, and immunology. 

&#x200B;

P.S. Those were what I studied in school. I have a PhD in the stuff. The vaccine is safe. Vaccines are safe. Do not worry.There was some studies where in regard to fertility in majority their sperm count and fertility slightly improved .. to trust it or not suppose more studies will clear that up ..Stop listening to the fear mongers. You’ll be just fine. If something would have gone terribly wrong it would have already.You people need to stop smoking methamphetamineWhy there was 99.5 percent chance you would live. That’s scary, your more likely to die in a car crash. You got to buckle up lolTo be honest , the stress of your thinking about it is probably worse than any side effects. I personally don’t think there will be much effects , eat , sleep , workout and look after yourself , and you will be perfect ❤️Sounds like you’ve got yourself in a bit of a rabbit hole. Don’t stress yourself because you’ve had the jab, you’ve had no side effects, just like most people and if you’re still worried, speak to a medical professional, not someone on Reddit.Oh boy, are we doing this same ole schtick? I was hoping that after the shut down people would come back with actual conspiracies. But here we are with people’s testimonials about getting vaccinated. You don’t even know how to do it right. Your parents were scared so you got the vaccine. Now you’ve been scared so you regret getting the vaccine? People need to grow the fuck up. There doesn’t seem to be any hope that this sub will one day be about conspiracies again.I wouldn't worry about. Chances are you will be fine. I have had three shots and I'm honestly in better shape than I was this time last year, I recently got back to the gym and am feeling great. I never had any side effects from any of the 3 shots.You have no reason to be worried. Any adverse effects are extremely rare and would have occurred already.Does your family typically get group medical procedures?Lol what a ridiculous sentiment. Do you stress over every food you eat, everything you smoke, vape, clothes you wear, water you swim in, places you sleep in? All things that can cause long term side effects?

Be seriousIt’s taken me so long to realize this, but once I did I noticed my mental health at least somewhatThe vaccines are extremely safe. There have been billions of doses given and thousands of studies on their safety:

Vaccine safety


https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2784015

In this interim analysis of surveillance data from 6.2 million persons who received 11.8 million doses of an mRNA vaccine…This analysis found no significant associations between vaccination with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and selected serious health outcomes


https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2034577

A total of 43,548 participants underwent randomization, of whom 43,448 received injections. Safety over a median of 2 months was similar to that of other viral vaccines.


https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2110475

In the vaccination analysis, the vaccinated and control groups each included a mean of 884,828 persons.  In this study in a nationwide mass vaccination setting, the BNT162b2 vaccine was not associated with an elevated risk of most of the adverse events examined. 


https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-021-02059-5

A total of 87 publications with safety data from clinical trials and post-authorization studies of 19 COVID-19 vaccines on 6 different platforms were included. Available evidence indicates that eligible COVID-19 vaccines have an acceptable short-term safety profile.


https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(22)00054-8/fulltext

Safety data from more than 298 million doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine administered in the first 6 months of the US vaccination programme show that most reported adverse events were mild and short in duration.


https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00290-x

It is clear that coronavirus vaccines are safe and effective.


https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmv.27940

In this review, we synthesized the safety data of seven published RCTs and found that COVID-19 vaccines have shown good safety in the child and adolescent populations. Based on the systematic analysis of the published safety data of the four COVID-19 vaccines, we concluded that the safety of current COVID-19 vaccines for children and adolescents is acceptable. 


https://www.ersnet.org/news-and-features/respiratory-digests/safety-and-efficacy-of-the-bnt162b2-mrna-covid-19-vaccine-through-6-months/?amp=1

This paper shows a favourable safety profile for the BNT162b2 vaccine.


https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2022.972464/full

Overall cumulative rates for reported sAEFI following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in the US over 1 year were very low.


https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2209367

Two 25-μg doses of the mRNA-1273 vaccine were found to be safe in children 6 months to 5 years of age and elicited immune responses that were noninferior to those in young adults


https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2798504?utm_campaign=articlePDF&utm_medium=articlePDFlink&utm_source=articlePDF&utm_content=jamanetworkopen.2022.42240

These findings suggest COVID-19 vaccination is not associated with an increased risk of herpes zoster, which may help to address concerns about the safety profile of COVID-19 vaccines


https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(22)00407-6/fulltext

The retrospective cohort included 94 169 participants who received the first booster and 17 814 who received the second booster. Comparing the 42 days before and after vaccination, the second booster was not associated with any of the 25 adverse events investigated, including myocardial infarction


https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(22)00426-1/fulltext

COVID-19 mRNA vaccines have a good safety profile in pregnancy.


https://www.bmj.com/content/377/bmj.o1170

Although pain at the vaccination site and fatigue were the commonest side effects, there were no vaccine related serious adverse events, and the fourth doses were safe and well tolerated, the authors said.you think it causes infertility?I was prepared to live on the streets until I got a new job/house if I had to. My wife was on the same page luckily. 

Luckily my job was smart. They sent out communication about possibly having to mandate when Biden was trying to push the (any company with more than 100 employees mandate). But they kept holding out and weren't going to mandate unless they had to. When that stupid mandate was tossed in courts, my company was quick to let everyone know, they wouldn't be mandating it.

Either way, there was no way I was ever going to take it. No matter what it cost me. It was about so much more than just taking a shot vs not taking it. I was never going to bow down to those psychos. Years later, never had one and never got covid. No one in my family did. So glad I had the sense and the balls to follow through.the issue with this particular "vax" is that it didn't qualify as one so they re-defined what vaccine means, which was fishy.

2nd The President  succesfully cured his covid with no side effects when the vaccines were not available, so that was weird as well.

3rd no local covid incidents, and no local death, it all appeared in the fake news and online propaganda, nor there was any home incidents around nor any ppl dying from it, the first positive cases of "COVID-19" appeared later only when the fake PCR test started been distributed and forced in health facilities and Hospitals. 

4th Many Public Health Authority figures and doctors spoke about the innacurate data and basically admitting there were a lot of false data attributing death to COVID (before the vaccine's were available) 

5th CDC imposed dangerous protocols for all Hospitals to treat patients, such as forced ventilators with tons of drugs and a new drug Remdesevir which many nurses attributed to cause all COVID related death.

6th later on the vaccine finally became available, people were coerced to get it, which was strange, for a re-branded flu basically. The bullying, intimidation and lies were strange. The CDC and other criminals sponsored and paid for falsified peer reviewed studies claiming the vax helped with the ~~rebranded flu~~ COVID-19 and that unvaxed were dying. The media used this fake peer reviewed studies to create propaganda and literally turn the entire population agaisnt the only ones that were healthy and in the right side of History.Wait til you find out that there is just as much shady shit if not more surrounding childhood vaccines. 

They aren't inherently evil or bad. But the same crooks are involved and they skip safety studies, make fake (ghost write) studies, hide data/studies that show anything negative about their products (vaxxs), silence anyone in DC that ask questions,  pay doctors and regulators off to push unnecessary and more dangerous ones (hep B vaccine on day one of life), give too many in a short amount of time, bad batches are produced all the time, and children do get injured and even die wayyyy more than people realize.Hate to break it to you but you could of stood up for yourself and said no to it so you weren’t forced to take it, per say. I gave up my job, had to sell my house and started my own business. It was tough but my health and family is worth it.Your a brand NEW reddit account PUSHING VACCINE PROGANDA. FUCK YOUGotta love capitalism, am I right?What I found interesting now is the push for kids to get it has stopped. The doctors office my kids go to doesn’t even carry it. You have to make a special appointment at another office for it to be even considered.Don’t trust anecdotes. Trust scientific studies that are conducted by the companies that want to make money off you.The pharma scientists who made the vaccine didn’t take it, remember? They said they didn’t want to “skip to the front of the line”. 

Unforgivable.I got the original 2 doses and now regret. I didn't see the point of the vax since I had already had the virus and fought it off, but my job was being threatened and everyone around me would have alienated me (side note, it's amazing how tribal we are and how we need to feel included). Before the news came out on the ineffectiveness of the vax and potential side effects, my child got covid and fought it off in 36 hours. As soon and she recovered everyone around me preached on how now was a great time to get her vaxxed. I simply asked, "Why? She fought it off in less than 2 days."

Their response constantly was "Just get vaxxed" They had nothing else. "Just get vaxxed". I'd bring up natural immunity and the fact that we fought it off quickly. "Cool, now go get vaxed". Some even threatened that it was child abuse if I didn't get them vaxxed.

People in general don't seem to think for themselves and just follow the narrative.  Just use your own brain, pause, and think for a second.

Be healthy, lose some weight if you are obese, cut the alcohol and crap food, drink more water, get some sun, eliminate some stressors. That is the best medication.Forced

adjective  
Imposed by force; involuntary.

The word you are looking for coerced.I'm pleasantly surprised and pleased to see such a logical and not outright antivax reply. Kudos!

That being said, for OP, I think a lot of people forget that all medicine is poison and all poison is medicine. Everybody's genetics, environment, and overall health is different and as such everyone's body will react differently to the same treatment. Nearly every modern medicine has some percentage of recipients who experience extreme and rare side effects which can sometimes include disability or death. But more often than not nearly everyone who receives that same medicine will be perfectly fine. If you've gone several years without experiencing debilitating complications then I would go ahead and assume you're fine. 

I had the initial shot and two boosters, but I will no longer be getting more. I think the virus has lost steam. Unfortunately I caught covid before the vaccine was even available and have ever since suffered with long covid issues. I was also infected with covid twice more after getting the vaccine but both of those cases were extremely mild. Although we are calling it long covid it's not any different than the rare but not unheard of symptoms sometimes associated with viral infections. 

Bottom line, don't stress and just do your best to live a healthy life, because tomorrow is promised to no one. We're all in this together, sick or healthy, and nobody gets off this rock alive.

Edit for spellingI second the faith thing. I started really revisiting my faith and God during 2020 after I got sober and I’m completely changed for the better. I get a lot of hate on Reddit because I’m Christian but I don’t even care. God is the only reason I am here today and that’s the truth.True. Testosterone levels have been lowering a fair bit pre Covid>...stay righteous.

As it is written: “There is no one righteous, not even one; there is no one who understands; there is no one who seeks God. All have turned away, they have together become worthless; there is no one who does good, not even one.” “Their throats are open graves; their tongues practice deceit.” “The poison of vipers is on their lips.” “Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness.” “Their feet are swift to shed blood; ruin and misery mark their ways, and the way of peace they do not know.” “There is no fear of God before their eyes.” 

This righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no difference between Jew and Gentile, for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,
Romans 3:10‭-‬18‭, ‬22‭-‬23 NIV

https://bible.com/bible/111/rom.3.10-23.NIVANOTHER 2 YEAR ACCOUNT . MAKE THIS MAKE SENSE. YOUR PUSHING VACCINE PROPSo you think this was just a test by the higher-ups to see if enough people would follow? Definitely not trusting ANY government after this. Good learning experience.Yes, I too agree with this person. I would guess 90% or more of people - across the globe, mind you, so we're talking billions of people - who got the CoVax will be just fine overall in the long term. Some people might experience negative side effects, but the majority won't, as is the case with other vaccines and preventative healthcare measures.

The CoVax was an exercise in control, effectiveness of certain propaganda, and also a major con by big pharma to just fill their coffers.You're pretty much spot on here. The debilitating side effects are rare(ish), but we pretty much got free clinical trial data from millions of people. There are people that make low six figures being guinea pigs for clinical trials, I've met a few. For phase 3 you're lookin at a few grand easy for a single trial.

I don't work in mRNA but I work adjacent to it (Mabs). Lots of mRNA work is starting up in every pharma company now. I have very little experience and I like my job, so meh.Maybe OP was in a placebo region. One can only hopeI started my own business at the start of covid as well comrade, to get every cent I work for is very freeing.  I don't think I will ever be able to work for anyone else again, the amount of money that companies made off of my work without doing a fucking thing is really put into perspective.I had a large amount of student debt and was forced out of school and they locked anyone out of online programming who was not vaccinated after promising you could complete your degree online. Can’t get a job in that field without my degree and back during that time period anywhere hiring was requiring you to be vaccinated for COVID. I’m still feeling the financial effects however few years after and I will be for probably most of my life because I’m a wage worker. It’s hard to pay off $20,000+ when you make 2k a month and over 75%+ of that goes to basic living necessities you can’t go without.Hamburgers I get.. But DONUTS??Someone in another comment said that a lot of the "vaccines" were just saline. This would make sense I guess cause if there is something bad in the actual substance, they wouldn't want 5.5 billion people to be affected by it.💯 i got the original vax too and even though now i see through the BS, im not sweating it. that was over 2 years ago and my health has never been better. sure a bunch of people were proven to have negative effects from it and i sure as hell will never get these silly boosters, but if you haven’t had any issues at this point what could possibly happen in the future from a vax received years ago. we learned and now they’ll never pull that stunt on us again>ignorance

Those who took it were ignorant of the corruption inherent in the industry 

>scientific illiteracy

The scientifically literate knew to avoid it. Only those bralnwashed into thinking the system was infallible fell for itSo you think all of those theories about population control or putting a chip in or purposely causing bad health to make more money for pharmaceutical companies are false?Yes but alot of them were saline....>Freaking out about it now is just paranoia 

I agree with that to an extent.

Just unsure as to what do you mean by this:

>Hundreds of millions were given out.Thanks for the reminder that fearmongering can go both ways. I don't think I'm going to drop dead I'm just scared that there will be issues with my children.hun the  anti-vaxx mf on twitter is not blabbering about it ppl droping dead, the press is publishing non-stop videos and news articles of healthy vaxxed people suddenly just like wtf learn to read or just be delusional like u currently insist to pretend to be"The 'worst day of your life' SO FAR!"Yes because there are shills in a conspiracy sub trying to do……?Yes becuase Im sure the big scary governments of the world want their tax payers to die to a vaccine they paid for.

Sometimes the truth is just boring, there was a disease, and countries like having live people and active economies.Over a million now..still no takers….the money will go to charity if the debate against Kennedy is accepted…any one here?[I wouldn't be so sure about that.](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/09/09/1035489298/tiktok-covid-vaccination-megan-blankenbiller-hospital)I’m just going to guess at least one regretted not getting it.So you're saying there have been people specifically studying the vaccine to find things wrong with it? I took the Phizer one; have you heard of anything found long term about that one?> scientific consensus

ROTFL.  Science is not a democracy. 

>There is no mechanism by which long term side effects could occur. 

That's not true. The mechanism for, for instance, the rapid development of cancer is known and it is a very possible side effect of the covid shots.

Remove spaces and ***Peter McCullough sells a spike support supplement that has shown to work and there are many other things you can do. SLEEP and detox are good. Also, you need to start sourcing food and water that isn’t poisoned. They’re putting this shit into everything now.Mate, a word of advice, you're not going to be able to find any kind of valid health advice here. If you're legitimately concerned, talk to a doctor - not unqualified strangers on the internet.

That said, you most certainly do not need to "cleanse" your body. The idea that some tea, or a bath, or some other vague solution will  somehow remove "toxins" from your body is absurd.I keep hearing about pine needle tea as a good detox, disclaimer I haven't looked into it myself but you may want toVitamin D, Magnesium, CBD oil, Pine Needle tea, Curcuma, Black cumin seed, Zeolite Detox, Quercetine, Artemesia Annua, Nattokinase, Zinc

There was a powerpoint from doctors going around saying this should help. Of course idk if it is total bs, but most of the things are healthy to take anyways from the list 🤷‍♀️Pine needle tea, pomegranate peel tea, apple pectin, activated charcoalCleanse what? Can these "toxins" be seen under a microscope? And Then they leave the body? Like you piss/shit them out?   


Is there any studies where waste was measurably free of these mysterious toxins but present in the blood stream, and then someone does a cleanse, and they can now measure these toxins in waste and no longer detect them in blood?

Edit: everyone down voting but no-one can tell me what these mysterious toxins areThere's a spike protein detox guide here:

I have not used it, and I can't vouch for its effectiveness or the credentials of the authors. You must exercise your own discretion and judgement as to whether you wish to try it.Second on the cilantro. Mostly 'cuz I love Tacos and Enchiladas.Thanks for the advice. I will eat a lot of cilantro. I also need to start strengthening my connection with god, like you said.Huge emphasis on that last part.Yeah I'm a minor and didn't have any of my own beliefs back then (i just had the same as my parents ig).Yeah, because doctors actually spend thousands of hours each year researching the medicine that is pushed on them by the pharmacy companies, instead of running their practices and living their lives.For sure I just hope this was a test, so they could see if the greater operation will work.You mean kinda like the whole qanon thing?So the vaccine could cause issues with my bloodline?Some got the actual vaccine but, some batches of vaccines weren’t stored at the proper cold temperature, there were sitting room temp. 

It could be akin to leaving milk out on your counter for a week, then drinking that milkHe was a minor who was made to get it by his parents. Not his faultIs it worth trying even after 2 years?A gallon a day or more and you flush everything out, and if you tie in a 16-8 fast cycle, you can almost feel your body healing. All those aches and pains for no reason, gone. It breaks down old cells and DNA fragments and uses them for energy all while creating fresh replacements. Whether it's detox or help with weight loss or just to feel better, I recommend it.But would still get the blood they’d needI get all my news and information from Joe RoganSo, myocarditis and cancer symptoms are never subclinical? 🙄not in my opinion after seeing how uncertain even our own government that is pushing this into us is about it; + seeing the state of the government right now, but that's for another thread.Just because you haven't taken the vaccine doesn't mean that your blood is pure. If you've been exposed to glyphosate, pesticides, preservatives, and heavy metals, and other toxins, then your blood isn't pure. You seriously need a detox.we can never have a blood transfusion or anything like that though now. tainted blood everywhere loli mean i didnt have any bad effects after the injection, only soreness in the armI’m so sorry they did that to you. Props for protecting your family.You believe everything you see on TV and read online eh? 🤡i was either 12 or 13 when I got it I don't exactly rememberSo your saying that a lot of the conspiracies are also fearmongering?99.5 percent chance i would survive covid? are you asking why I got the vaccine?Fucking Klaus Schwab info warrior here.People have gotten serious side effects from it, and people have died from it. You must be living under a rock.Good luck being a test subject, as there is zero long term study data. Nada. None. All the papers and medical journal peer reviews you cite have no idea what these vaccines will do 1-5 years from now, or 15 for that matter. Even Pfizer's stage 3 trial only lasted 6 months.

I prefer to stay in the control group, thank you.1500% increase in myocarditis as per FDA last week.The vac causes “turbo cancer” in this subwe all know vaccination induces a profound impairment in type I interferon signaling, which has diverse adverse consequences to human health- like cancer. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027869152200206X https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9012513/What I think is irrelevant, I'm just another cog in the machin, only time will tellShort of putting a gun to a family members head i wasn't going to take it. I'd like to think I don't have a price but if I do its certainly more than a hamburger a donut or even some 70k a year jobI felt exactly the same and it was actually a pretty scary time, realizing everything I had built up might be lost because I would never succumb.  I also work for a conservative company and 90% of my fellow employees were on the same page.  No jab, and turned out we all held out long enough for common sense to make a comeback, if ever so slightly.Same. My job was about to force it on us before the Supreme Court stepped in at the last minute. I was making preparations to live in my car and be homeless. Nothing threat will ever make me take those poison jabs.hear hear!     


i was job searching for a darn good year, between mid 2021 and 2022.   right when so many companies where i live were mandating this and not even allowing the 'test instead' option as an alternative.  not that i'd ever get the shots nor take the tests.  i won't be a part of the bullshit that went haywire. at all.  and managed to survive while doing exactly that.  and didn't end up homeless, nor starving, nor with any detriment toward my kid that i single parent.  


I was sick as a dog in early 2020, just before covid was a thing.  have not been sick at all since.   and i take the public bus and smoke like a chimney and don't eat all that healthy nor take any supplements or anything.  if anyone was likely to get sick in the last couple years, it was me.    yet i fared just fine and those around me that had two or more of the shots have all had some form of respiratory illness since taking the shots.  and some had covid more than once since getting two or more of the shots too.> no local covid incidents, and no local death

This was always my thing. I live near the center of a major metro, and I don’t know a single person who was hospitalized from Covid. Not even my octogenarian neighbor who caught the virus. To my knowledge, I don’t even know anyone who *knows* anyone who was hospitalized, except for a FB friend I haven’t seen in years who says it killed his father.

And they say “oh just because you don’t see it near you doesn’t mean it’s not happening.” But if it was such a ubiquitous problem, I would have. Especially since the numbers for my area were supposedly very high. And I did know *many* people who caught it, myself included. 

Fuck outta here, is what I’m saying.Number 5 saved my life when I had Covid (December 2021) and I was in the hospital for a month in a medically induced coma. 
Scariest time of my life, I really thought I was going to die.  I emptied out my bank accounts and sold my crypto then gave the money to my parents to hold onto in case I didn't pull through.I know a handful of people who got it but one was hospitalized. In a city that 2 million with the suburbs.My gf and I have come to the agreement well get our kids vaccinated with the 6 or 8 vaccines they were doing in the 70s or 80s but nothing more. Still don't like the idea of injecting a kid with mercury and formaldehyde and heavy metals but risk reward I guess>	they skip safety studies, make fake (ghost write) studies, hide data/studies that show anything negative about their products (vaxxs), silence anyone in DC that ask questions,  pay doctors and regulators off

If doing all this to make money on a product that is injected into children isn’t evil or bad - what is?Exactly. Anyone condemning covid vax, but prefacing their stance on vaccines is a shill and is still validating the harm that has been done to kids in the 80's to present time due to the hyper increase of  vaccine doses that are mandatory in schools.

 There is a clear association between number of required doses in kids and the rise in learning disabilities, social disorders, autism, mental illness, and confused sexual identity. Autism cases were extremely rare before the 80's, but now it's extremely common to be on the spectrum. 

Instead of addressing the issues, big pharma invests in controlling the mainstream media, and social media influencers by promoting the idea of normalizing autism and sexual deviancy in the same way they normalize obesity. They 100% know that they have created a generation of sick and complacent kids that are malleable to the government agenda.

What does this mean? Outside of this niche subreddit and select few others, you aren't allowed to even utter an antivax opinion out loud without fear of immediate reprisal. Antivax sentiment is logical after the pharmaceutical industry during covid forever destroyed trust in any future vaccines. Your comment implies antivax sentiment is illogical, when the only illogical position on that topic today would be to still blindly place faith in the efficacy or safety of vaccines. Antivax sentiment is a logical response to the coercion and authoritarianism we all just witnessed.Hey you have a pleasant tone and I agree. Nothing will kill you Faster than thinking you’re gonna die everyday. That being said the “long covid” aspects of this bio weapon (and that’s what it was legally) need to be addressed and people who played along to get along need to be held accountable. 

If you (anyone reading this) were part of any coercion of family or friends you need to own it and make things right. This is the greatest evil perpetrated on humanity because of the tech we are dealing with at this stage in the game…. Oh and they’ve done this MANY times before. 

The name Fauci in his native land means “sickle of the harvest”. We are in a war against unimaginable darkness and covid was just the beginning. There are more viruses to come and much shock and awe all around.

Also The “long covid”… its the same as with hiv and aids patients, and its from hiv glyco protein 120. It’s lowered global IQ points and is killing people short term, medium term, and long term. Seek out and face the actual science (its out there) and do not listen to anyone who told you to take this. That’s the media or the doctors. The protein is toxic and causes neurodegenerative disorders. The more you get the worse you are and some people’s bodies have transfected the protein and are creating it within their own cells. It is genetic dependent and you are in a war based on DNA after everyone just handed over all of their’s (and likely close family members) with every swab and PCR you took.

It kills the immune system, the brain and the heart, and the next one is gonna hit heavier and harder with everyone having compromised immune systems.

Try listening to the people you were trying to put in jail and called crazy, and take responsibility.

There’s no sense in regret, what’s done is done and at some point you have to forgive yourself but please take action and do the research to try and get this protein out of your system because despite what the media told you, you are now shedding prion proteins (like Madcow) on the rest of us who did our research, knew the dangers before the vaccine was widely adopted, and are now suffering the consequences  and health effects from our friends and family coming down with cancers and dying left and right. All the while opening ourselves up to more and more exposure because these prions don’t just go away.

They stay in the environment. Killing them with fire is barely doable because of the temperature’s needed. As always God and good will win but this was a huge hit to the world. As Ian Malcolm famously said in Jurassic Park “life finds a way”… and now we all must do just that. 

Accept that you’re in a biological war with bloodlines and knighthoods that you’ve likely never heard of and do the right thing the next time. The rest of us really need you to nut up and help us because we all barely made it through the first time.

I sometimes go back and watch highlight reels from all the major media shows and comedy hours that shamed the unvaccinated. It’s disgusting hearing jimmy Kimmel call for my death if I dont want a mystery juice that changes my genome and kills me forced upon me. That crushes families with debt and murders patients who were told it was wrong and stupid to “do their own research”. Quit being lazy and do the work. The media is bought and is propaganda meant to brainwash you and based on how things went down they did their job splendidly. 

I watch it because everyone wants to pretend this is over, wants to pretend it never happened, wants to “move on”, we are 3 years into a 10 year war of a fight that has been raging for 10,000 years and most people haven’t a clue what I mean when I say that here.

“Lost it’s steam”… I seriously hope you didn’t pressure anyone else to feel like you weren’t alone in your decision.

This has just begun and famine will come soon. Along with war to kill off excess males who have nothing to live for and have been going through conditioning telling them they’re weak and toxic for the past decade, now being told they’re not a real man unless they go die for some evil fuckers they’ve never met on the other side of the planet.

Seriously. It’s time for humanity to grow up and evolve, take responsibility and end this once and for all.

No more cowards, no more traitors, no more secret societies and no more genocides.

YOU HAVE HOMEWORK TO DO.

Go on Rumble and Find Dr John Coleman’s speech roughly 25 years ago on the Committee of 300. Start wrapping your brain around what has been happening over generations and face the darkness within yourself that allowed us to get here. The shadow that prevents you from seeing that this evil is truly out there. Own it within yourself and make amends.

They have no authority except that which is given. Deny them that. Get back to basics and lose the tools of your oppressors or use them against them.

Go check him out, friendHow could you trust ANY government *before* this occurence, knowing the history of the world. It's just one big squabble for power, with violence, conspiracies, political machinations, ethnic cleansing, and treachery. From the Roman Empire, to the Spanish Empire, to the Nazi Empire, to whatever authority that has been able to force the injections upon the so-called "independent" countries, almost all over the entire world. Human history has been filled with incidents of such evil. I am honestly not surprised. It would be foolish to expect good intentions from ANY political organization. The 21st century is no different from the 20th century, or the 19th century, or the 16th century. The only difference is that the advanced technology has allowed governments and militaries to be more effective and much more deadly. When will all this end? When will have have a more or less normal society? In 1000 years, maybe?There's a surefire way to know what to do when a dilemma is presented in front of you and you are not sure what to choose.

You listen to what the majority of the news outlets and governments suggest and you do the exact opposite.

This way you are certain to make the right decision without even needing to apply critical thinking.

Bottomline, there's nothing I would trust less than governments. Probably not even high tier criminals. And I am not exaggerating.Not only a test, but also the 'foundation' needed to make new rules, laws and (international) agreements which will be used during the next plandemic or other threat.You’ll be fine.  All the conspiracy shit is insanityParanoia lol. The world exists outside of America...Definitely not about the money mainly. Money was a nice extra, but 100% not the main reason. They lost way more money with the nonsense lockdowns and the destruction of the global economy.There’s definitely a lot more to it than money.No its not, they print the money and tell our leaders what to do. This is not about money. Please stop trying to go back to sleep and make right with those who you’ve wronged. This is just getting started and we are not going back to pre covid era. The fact that you have any delusions around that say a lot about the role you played in this. OWN IT. make it right and do better “the next time”.Neh, money is just a tool for "them",  the real war is spiritual.You have no idea what youre talking about because this kills over time in many different ways based on genetics. This is not about money. The people who did this have all the money, they print the money, they authorize the spending and own everything you think is yours.

This is about power and control and you need to do more research.> The debilitating side effects are rare(ish)

Ehhh, an on average 15+% more excess deaths is not caused by a rare event...Some people just like to hear their own voiceJust because someone said they were saline don’t make it so.My vaccine was actually just green jello.Correct, there was actually coordination between major vaccine companies as they released different batches of the jab. Heck, they even had an app where you could look up your batch number and see how dangerous it was compared to othersRight.  Dr. Peter McCullough recently said that about 1/3 of the shots seemed to have no side effects, which 2/3rds had moderate effects.  He also said about 5% had severe side effects or death.> Someone in another comment said that a lot of the "vaccines" were just saline.

howbadismybatch dot com.If you don't mind me asking, how old were you when you got the vaccine?Looks like your body absorbed the impact of the vaccine. Other people weren't so lucky. Just because you haven't had any side effects, doesn't mean that other people didn't. Some people just have lesser health reserves in general, and it takes less of a hit to cause their bodies to fail. Some people can withstand a lot of toxin and injury. Other people are just naturally weak and frail.>While some clots may lay dormant and undiagnosed for years, even decades....Jun 7, 2019.

2 years doesn't mean you are 100% out of the woodsSo my parents decided for me to get it. They are republican but apparently, their reasoning was that since Isreal was giving their people vaccinations, it was probably safe since the whole idea of Isreal is to keep the Jewish people safe.This is the dumbest bullshit I've ever read.

Quite literally the ONLY people who chose not to get vaccinated (ie. those without compromised immune systems, or other extenuating circumstances) were the scientifically illiterate. There were like 2 actual MDs who were anti-vax, the other 99.999% got vaccinated.

You'd have to be so fucking ignorant of reality to think that the scientifically literate avoided the vaccine, that it's almost incomprehensible to think anyone could be that stupid. JFC...This is hilarious to read.  Another award worthy commentHave you been needing to go to the hospital? It's been like 2-3 years and people are still having babies. This sub I swear is less conspiracy and more paranoiaI think it's the latter. The more people get side effects, the more clients will get created for the Big Medicine Industry. People will start getting sick, people will start going to doctors to treat their sudden onset sicknesses. Big Pharma/Medicine is a business model. They make people chronically sick, turning people into lifetime clients. Just imagine the number of extra appointments that doctors will be getting, all those drug prescriptions, surgeries, insurance payments. If doctors would be focused on actually healing the people, and preventing the people from getting sick in the first place, there would be very few clients for the Big Pharma/Medicine Industry.You were on site and in the lab running tests on them?they meant that a bunch of doses of the vaccine were administeredOk, let's be fair here. For sure, the vaccine is definitely not good for you. But that's not the only thing in modern society. There are lots of environmental factors just as bad, if not worse. For example, wireless 5G radiation, toxic pesticides, preservatives, artificial sweetners, artificial colors and dyes which are absolutely everywhere, hormone disruptors in the public water supply, asphalt dust that you breathe in, microplastics, glyphosate, leaking underground tanks in gas stations, the list goes on and on. While any one of these factors in isolation is harmful in it's own right, but the organism can recover from the damage, multiple factors converging together would surely end in the death or disability of the person sooner or later. The modern industrialized society is literally killing us. The human organism was not meant to survive in such a sea of toxins. Therefore it is imperative to minimize your exposure to any toxins going forward from here, if you want to maintain your and your children's health and survival in the dystopian world.

People around here are proud to have "pure blood" because they haven't gotten the vaccine. Oh yeah, but what about the other environmental toxins that you are affected by? They make your blood dirty too. The best way is to live a "clean" or "green" life, away from civilization, in the middle of the woods or something. To grow your own vegetables, drink clean well water, and not go to the doctor except if it's an emergency that you can't handle using Traditional Chinese Medicine. Live similar to the Amish, wait for a couple generations, until all the city folks start to die off from the sea of toxins that they are daily exposed to. Then it will be time to create a new civilization based upon ecological principles.If it makes you feel any better everyone I know who got the vax seems to be fineThe goverment doesn't give a shit about us they can just print and spend as much money as they want and launder it through unimaginable schemes.

And since when does the cold is to be considered as a lethal and contagious disease?

It's already 2023 and everybody around here is done with this B/S, fuck off.Tens of thousands of people across the globe have been involved in studying the various different vaccines across the globe. And even before its release, Pfizer, Moderna, and other pharmaceutical companies conducted trials to determine its safety and efficacy - so yes, people do specifically study these things. 

From what these trials and studies have uncovered, common side effects from the vaccine include headache, fatigue, pain, chills, and other minor symptoms like that. In *extremely rare* cases, it's been found that the vaccine can additionally cause ailments like myocarditis, anaphylaxis, and blood clots. But again, the rates of these occurring are astronomically low - according to [the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/adverse-events.html#:%7E:text=Myocarditis%20and%20pericarditis%20after%20COVID,rest%20and%20felt%20better%20quickly.), for instance, anaphylaxis occurs in ~5/1,000,000 doses given, and the other ailments have similarly low rates as well.

And as far as long term side effects, for one, there isn't any mechanism by which they could actually occur, as I mentioned. All vaccine materials leave your body in a matter of weeks following the vaccination. To my knowledge, there has been no documented evidence showcasing the development of side effects from any of the Covid vaccines an extended period after they've been administered.

If you're looking for a more specific study to reinforce these ideas, there's quite a few linked on the CDC page I already linked, but [here's](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2110475) another aiming to determine side effects associated with the Pfizer vaccine. The vast majority of side effects observed were not determined to be statistically likely to have arisen from the vaccine, barring myocarditis.Look up documentaries by Robert Malone, Carrie Madej, Jane Ruby, Mike Yeadon on Rumble. They are independent scientists who are telling you the real truth about the vaccines. Disregard whatever the previous commentator said. Do your own research to learn the truth.

A whole horde of scientists could be thinking one thing, and they would still be wrong. One single independent scientist could be more right than lots of laboratories, schools, and government commissions. Don't underestimate people with independent critical thinking and an open mind.You just posted the worst “supporting evidence” I think I’ve ever seen on Reddit.

The only one that can even be considered close to an actual study has been widely debunked.

“The Seneff et al. paper is still available without any note of editorial concern and has been widely read, propagated, and cited despite several gross errors observed. Public health consequences of publishing claims like “billions of lives are potentially at risk” with COVID-19 mRNA vaccines in a renowned scientific journal are not anecdotal, especially when the article is widely disseminated among general public. It is indeed the second most shared paper of the journal according to Altmetric data, with an attention score of 18541, 2nd/4980 outputs from the FCT Journal in 2022. With such high metrics, we could expect a paradigm-breaker article. In details, the authors claim that mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are responsible for the “suppression of type I interferon responses” resulting “in impaired innate immunity” and therefore that they “potentially cause increased risk to infectious diseases and cancer”. Such strong claims probably explain the public attention raised by this article, but these assertions are not supported by the cited literature, the suggested mechanisms rely on a cascade of improbable and unsupported hypotheses.”How can you not believe the overall medical community but believe some random websites paper?      

One of those links - “The 13-year pattern of declining birth rate in England/Wales is illustrated above in Chart 3. Note the uptick at the end of 2020 going into 2021 that may indicate the effect of lockdowns and then release from lockdowns.”

Please post more links.  This is amazing contentMany toxins are water soluable. Many teas have diuretic properties. A hot bath will help you sweat the toxins out, especially under the armpits through direct expose to the lymphatic system with the water.Actually yeah go talk to the same qualified doctor who told you to take the jab you’re now trying to detox from. 

Should go well. Well done. Great advice from an unqualified stranger on the internet there.I saw a video on YouTube that if you drink urine from a pureblood it counter acts the effects of the jab...its a 3 week cleanse and can only drink urine doing that time..Thanks for the list. I'm just going to stock up on anything that could have the slightest possibility of helping because there is no harm even if it doesn't.People in this sub claim to think critically, then downvote the only comment in this thread of a person thinking criticallyThis.  This is so important.  The kids had no choice.Sure that’s one. There’s plentyIt could. What it did, if it did, I have no clueI think, knowing the pharmacy I got the vaccine at, they probably didn't store the vaccines like they were supposed to. If this is true and they didn't store it properly would this remove a lot of the bad side effects long term if any?Some people got the actual vaccine, but their bodies were strong enough to absorb the impact. They got sick for a few weeks, but after that they recovered quite well. Other people were not so lucky, because they had weak health systems in the first place. Some people are frail, and any amount of toxins would cause them to fail.Always. Also try a heavy metal detox.Yes. Do what this person is saying and don't drink water or any fluids for at least a week, week and a halfTrust him way more then main stream media and bought and purchased "experts"no its doesn't mean its pure but its waaay better then having that crap vax in you. all those other things you mention don't require a needle, there much harder to avoid and or even know about in the first place, almost just like a side effect of being on earth at this pointNo, but when the government tells us one thing (the virus is a hoax) and then does another (runs and takes the vaccine) it’s pretty obvious what the right move is.Okay so just read what I said and don't regret or panic.
This wasn't your fault and yes it wasn't exactly your parents either but we all know what happened.

Am so sorry that happened to you but don't let yourself get caught up in negative thinking just stay positive xx… Yeah? Can you prove me wrong?Yeah, and every single international independent medical researcher, academic medical institution, and the world's top medical journals are all lying.

I need a job to pay my taxes or they will show up with a gun and point it at my head and demand I leave my home.I know several people that were hospitalized due to complications when they had COVID. 

I also know several who had severe reactions after getting the shots.I have a friend who was hospitalized for a couple months and wasn’t sure if he was gonna make it. And I had a family friend who died from it as well. Because the survival rate was over 99%, you were probably never gonna see tons of people around you get hospitalized or die. But the fact is, that there were people who were hospitalized and died. To piggy back off that, both of the guys I knew lived very unhealthy lifestyles and the guy that died was extremely obese. So I’m definitely not saying that only Covid did this to people, but it definitely exacerbated existing problems.Sounds like Number 5 almost killed you.What saved your life the vaccine?

>Antivax sentiment is logical after the pharmaceutical industry during covid forever destroyed trust in any future vaccines.

The sentiment may be logical, but the way in which those who are for vaccines and those against it go back and forth in these particular spaces is toxic.

If you want to take a vaccine, don't shame someone for not taking the vaccine, then proceed to go on a hyperbolic diatribe about how someone is putting your life in danger with their cooties.

If you're an anti-vaxxer--a label in which I despise--refrain from shaming people for taking the jab and also stop antagonizing people with your jab memes, disguising your toxic behavior behind the preface that you're trying to "wake up the people".

I don't think any human being should be forced to put a foreign cocktail in their body.  But I recognize that each individual has to make their own choices.  No need to shame someone for making a choice.And based on my solid background in Microbiology, and thorough understanding of mRNA technology, I am going to respectfully disagree with that opinion."They have no authority except that which is given"

This is where I'm at in this whole ordeal. We giveth and we can taketh. The only reason anybody has anything is because we allow them to have it.For the record I developed long covid before the vaccines were on the market. 

I'm sure I won't convince you of anything, but I'm going to have disagree with everything you said. For context I did my undergraduate study in Microbiology. 

The symptoms of long covid 100% correspond to the symptoms of many viral infections. It's called post-viral syndrome. Im not sure off the top of my head when it was first documented, but i know for a fact its documented in studies at least as far back as the 90s. Its only really getting a lot of attention now because covid infected billions of people and consequently millions of people developed the syndrome. Systemic inflammation is a documented effect of severe viral infections and damages nerve and organ tissue. Dealing with the plethora of issues brought on by systemic inflammation leaves the body open to a host of other opportunistic pathogens which can then exacerbate and extend recovery times. Some people never recover 100%. 

While I admit, there were absolutely a small percentage of the population who experienced severe reactions to the covid vaccines, some who even died, thats the case with literally every single modern medicine on the market. Sad to say, but it's going to happen when you can't account for every single comorbidity or genetic and environmental factor.You sound fucking nuts. Don't tell me I have homework to do, yet provide zero sources to read up on... I didn't take the vaccine to be on the safe side, but life is too short to be \**this*\* fearful without some sort of evidence backing those claims of yours up. ***Where's the fucking facts????*** You typed all of that and can't even tell me what to read up on?

Ya'll need to put down the pipe and read about actual gnosticism, hermeticism, metaphysics, numerology, the old world, esotericism, and sacred geometry & symbolism; ancient teachings that can actually enlighten ya'll instead of whatever this is...That's my paraphrasing of a quote from Paracelsus, “All things are poison and nothing is without poison; only the dose makes a thing not a poison.”Guarantee will make headache go away. May be some unwanted side effects however.You won’t be feeling the headache.The difference between medicine and poison is the doseDrink some bleach and stare at the sun for half an hour after your Alex Jones podcastLow does cyanide may have anti cancer properties. https://www.webmd.com/cancer/cancer-apricot-seedsYeah. Look up the flint water crises. That was among many of the historical lessons that told me not to get it. In fact I was very very close to getting it but the more they started lying and strong arming people the more I thought to avoid it. 

Here’s the breakdown of my process:

- ahhh I don’t want to put something new and untested into my body. Maybe I’ll get it later but I’m not going to be the first
- I see Dr. Malone say it does indeed change your dna
- saw a video where a pharmaceutical executive said people wouldn’t get it if they knew it was gene therapy so they had to rebrand.
- weird that they’re bribing people with “burgers, money and sex”. I’ve never seen anything like that
- man they, said 2 weeks to stop the spread but it’s been a lot longer than that
- what happened to Heard immunity???
- why aren’t they recognizing natural immunity??? In fact they’re demonizing anyone who talks about natural immunity
- ok, now they’re blaming Covid on the unvaccinated not (then taboo) the lab it leaked from. 
- they really really really want us to take this thing. The government never wants us to do something like this unless it’s bad for us. I think I’m good…That’s what I never understood during covid, people suddenly thought the government cared about your health? *since when?*Bro I in no way was opening this up to talk about all the people with myocarditis. I was talking about the intended goals, which most assuredly were to get billions of dollars worth of free clinical trial data.

It's not likely that it was known before their very biased clinical trials on what the side effects were. But they did know early on and continued to send out batches. The fact that we know certain batches had different rates of side effects most assuredly means they know, and they have deduced a reason for itFair enough, but I have read online of vaccines containing only saline ([https://www.wistv.com/2021/06/28/very-limited-number-saline-only-covid-vaccines-accidentally-given-health-dept-says/](https://www.wistv.com/2021/06/28/very-limited-number-saline-only-covid-vaccines-accidentally-given-health-dept-says/)). Now, I can't think of a logical way that they 'accidently' didn't put the other ingredients in. Makes zero sense.i was 30. my whole family also got it. my parents were in their mid 50’s and had no issues either. like i said in my prior response, i know a lot of people did have issues from it but some of these people on reddit/social media are so obsessed with fear mongering that they’ll link any issue a vaxxed person has back to the vax. so if you have a heart attack 30 years from now they’ll still be saying it was related to the vax you got 30 years ago. i will never get it again and i did not give my kids the vax, but for those of us who got it at some point and are living fine, no need to buy into these other goofs trying to put themselves on a throne for not getting itBro just argued in the affirmative for a vaccine lmaoclots are also a part of life that anyone can get at any time. im 100% against the covid vax, but there is some truth to the saying “correlation does not imply causation”. so if i get a blood clot 20 years from now i def am not blaming a vax i took 20 years agoLol, now THAT is ignorance!  ymmvyeah those guys that murder kids defo now whats best lolIf the government of Isreal wanted to keep the Jewish people safe, maybe they wouldn't be so belligerent against nearly every neighboring country, making the Muslims hate them. That's a bad long term strategy for keeping the Jewish people safe. It's not in the interests of the Jewish people to turn all the Muslims against them, especially with terrorists spreading their own anti-Jewish propaganda. Does the government of Isreal even care about the Jewish people, or is it just like all the other Western countries governments, completely self-serving with a planet-sized ego?Yeah dude I am laughing reading this thread. So much delusion and paranoia. Its unreal to think it is not satire but here we are.Do you have the sources to back up your claims?no i mean like long long term effectsFertility rates have reached record lows throughout western countries, this is despite the fact people have been working from home and having way more sex than ever in a very long time. There should've been a boom in kids not NEW unprecedented record lows.> people are still having babies.

Sure, the question is; how many..?

Didn't want to jump the gun initially, but I think that was to say that because a lot of people took it, that is why somehow safe for human consumption.  I sure hope that's not where they were going with that statement.All of it matters and everyone in this thread should be doing everything they can to get a clean source of food and water and change their lifestyles while they still have their mental faculties. If you haven’t noticed people have become passive and want to just pretend this never happened. We all have a duty to do better at this point and clean it up for future generations sake.i love this answer, nearly had a fight with my friend about all this, he thinks its ALL conspiracy nutjob talk. like all of it. such a shame how blind some are!> The modern industrialized society is literally killing us.

That's by design.So looking at purely the science, if the contents inside of the syringe are what they say, it is nearly impossible to have any long-term effects?So with this, why not trust the the cdc?  Any of the 1000s of medical papers written about Covid and the vax but trust a few randoms?      Do your own research?  On bloggers?   They are grifting clownsYou just listed the grifters and liars. Add McCullough and Kory to your list.

Malone

https://youtu.be/xjszVOfG_wo

https://decoding-the-gurus.captivate.fm/episode/robert-malone-peter-mccullough-a-litany-of-untruths

Dr. Malone has more than 134,000 subscribers to his Substack newsletter. About 8,000 pay the $5 monthly cost, he said, which would amount to at least $31,200 in monthly revenue.

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/03/technology/robert-malone-covid.htmlIt’s amazing to watch.  I bet the next proof you get is a YouTube video"It's debunked"... 

LOL.

Feel free to believe what you want but for those who do pay a little attention it's not hard to see the shots were not effective, nor safe.How can you not believe the overall medical community but believe some random websites paper? 

Create, an appeal to authority logical failure, an ad hominem and an attempt to insult in one.  Well done. 

You also did a great job at cherry picking.

Please post more comedy. LOL.We have this magical set of organs called the liver and kidneys which filter toxins out. You don't need some crazy tea or other "treatments" that do nothing more than make you smell weird or want to vomit because of how gross it is.

"Cleanses" are all snake oil created by grifters who want to make money off people who don't know any better.What "toxins" would these be then? Where did they come from? How can we observe them? What harm do they cause? How do these "water soluable" toxins survive in the human body? 

Before you start gung-ho recommending random treatments, you need well evidenced answers to all of these questions. Which I'm quite confident you don't have. There's a reason why scant few medical authorities or actual scientific journals would corroborate anything you're saying.Lmaooooo going to see an actual licensed medical doctor or listen to some crazy dude on YouTube  from a conspiracy subDefinitely potential harm in taking random vitamins and supplements sourced from somewhere you haven’t personally inspected. You trust random people on the internet but don’t trust the government?Try looking into zeolite (for heavy metal detox) and the boron cleanse (helps your cells regulate the expression of extra-cellular proteins). 

I also second the who gets closer to God thing. If you feel like you did the wrong thing pray to God and repent, and ask him for healing.[These supplements](https://www.firstmedinc.com/vaccine-detox-kits/) (which you can order online or locally usually pretty cheaply and easily) seem to have been working thus far. Here's some [case studies of people who've recovered](https://www.firstmedinc.com/side-effect-recovery/) from some pretty nasty "side effects" with them.You’d have to have someone look at the data and have them determine what occurs to the composition of said vaccine when not maintained at proper temperature. 

We know what happens to milk. It’s not longer nutritiousThat's the theory. You probably got luckyHow delusional can someone be... I'm not even gonna bother arguing, I feel sorry for you. I just hope you don't have children since you would probably also force them to take this unsafe and ineffective vaccine."Independent"

Once you learn that no independent studies without financial backing exist on a large scale, you'll start to understand the evil that is Big PharmaReally. Ok then please tell Reddit just how many mRNA based medicines made it to market and are still in use mr. expert. 

Please then explain the 1.5 million VAERS reports, 1 million from the US alone stating vaccine side effects since you attest they are so safe. Especially since historically 80% of VAERS reports come from health care professionals.

Maybe you can explain why the CDC had to change the definition of a vaccine just to ensure these covid vaccines met the definition because they were so ineffective in prevention and transmission. I noticed you only bleated that they are safe, not effective. Well, they are neither. 

If you would take a look which you won't, other countries are starting to ramp up legal efforts against the pharma makers due to ineffectiveness and high side effects issues.

Ok mr. expert maybe you can explain to reddit the perfectly logical explanation that if these vaccines are so safe effective, why did a manufacturer refuse to share trial data and  information about what is in the vaccines for 75 years and be shielded by the FDA? It took a fn court order in order for this information to be released. 

Also care to explain why if these vaccines are so safe, then why wont pharma stand behind their product and not be shielded from liability by the FDA? 

Go ahead and take your 4th booster. I am sure that's the one that will confer lasting immunity...

And about the HCA, I am sure I am fine, as even the CDC has indicated for my age group a 99.98% mortality rate. I have no immune deficency or comorbities. So that pretty much makes it next to nil. Not my numbers, the CDC. 

I hope that you have no lasting adverse effects. Which is a lot more positive than any of the ghouls in HCA would wish upon the control group. Israeli cohort study involving 196,992 unvaccinated adults found "no increase in the incidence of myocarditis and pericarditis" after COVID infection.

MIT study finds COVID vaccines 'significantly associated' with jump in emergency heart problems https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-10928-z

A peer-reviewed study from researchers in France has concluded that both the experimental Pfizer and Moderna vaccines significantly increase the risk of myocarditis compared to the unvaccinated. While both mRNA therapies were found to be linked to the life-threatening heart condition, the Moderna results were particularly shocking, especially among young adults, as researchers found the risk for myocarditis diagnosis following the Moderna jab was 44 times higher risk for individuals aged 18 to 24 years old. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-31401-5#Tab2

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.06.22277306v1Of course some people were hospitalized, as they are with the flu. I’m just saying the scope of the problem was grossly overstated.Yes of course. But the scale of the problem was vastly overstated by the media.a cold or flu could have done them in just the same, due to unhealthy lifestyle/weight/etc.Read #5 and you obviously need to do your research, rumble, yandex ur friends hunNope, I could not breathe on my own.  The meds kept my organs from failing and helped keep my fever (106+) under control.They said number 5 which was Remdesivir. Not the vaccine.I'm under no delusion that the vaccine was not the cure-all that the politicians and media made it out to be.   I was saying that the meds they pumped me with at the hospital and the incubator is what saved my life. 
I could not breath and they literally had to pack me on ice to keep my fever down.Thank you. The hallucinations from the meds were worse than the fear of death.That's your opinion. 
Just because I don't agree with you on a specific "conspiracy" dosen't mean I don't belong.  Stop being so close minded.Well when your dying just remember that you think medical help is only for clowns.It wasn't because my body was shutting down before they started the treatments. 

I could not breathe on my own. 
My fever was over 106 and was causing seizures.  They put me in a coma and packed me on ice for days to fight the fever and virus. 

I'm not saying the vac was the answer I'm saying the treatments that the hospital used saved my life.Are you just gonna ignore the rest of the definition? Force is literally in the definition and is listed as a synonym.What does your thorough understanding in mRNA technology have to say about Dr Robert Malone's deplatformed position on the dangers of covid vaccines?What opinion are you disagreeing with exactly?Take it back. Start small and local, it’s more important that state and federal.> thats the case with literally every single modern medicine on the market. 

True, but those risks are known through years of trials and research.  Not an experimental drug that we were told was "safe and effective". There are many who have not died from the vaxx but have life-changing medical issues likely as a result, issues that will never be acknowledged by the medical/scientific community because they have to CYA.They just caught a College professor doing terrible things to an animal all in the name of "blowing off steam". A college education doesn't amount to shit in this post Plandemic world which means your undergraduate study in microbiology has no bearing on Covid 19.Yea so did I and I never said anything about one being worse than the other, however there’s a reason that they wanted to keep “boosting” everyone.

Jimmy Fallon and aria da grande for the love of God, a booster song.

God.

Anyway. I had a heart spasm and blood platelet issues after being sick. I got it hard and it was bad and was given nothing and this is right before it was hitting the mainstream. I was staying in a hotel at the time. I called the doc back got some codeine syrup and slept for several days until it went away. The blood platelet issues manifested months later.

That being said it’s different than taking multiple injections of the stuff right into your blood system.

In the end spike is spike is spike.

And we’re all dealing with it.

I’m not saying one is worse than the other even though I do believe it to be, I’m saying  that we are all more at risk because of decisions made.

And while you might have some knowledge around microbiology, our institutions are completely captured and don’t teach people how to think critically which is why they were able to pull this off with paid prostitutes shilling songs on television.

Your degree means nothing to me and you should stay up to date on the current science.

It’s not a small percent of the population that experienced adverse events. Many people did and it is being reported as something else.

A friend of mine had a stroke and a brain aneurysm and his doctor blamed it on past chiropractics…

Seriously?!!! Seriously?!!!

That’s where we are at people.

Excess “unrelated” deaths are hovering around 20 percent and that is with skewed data.

Like I said the events work on the short term, medium term, and long term.

“Viruses” are mostly bio weapons research done by the DOD at military installations. It’s the same process to create the vaccine as it is the weapon and this has been going on for decades.

There is more to come. Robert Redfield came out himself and said that they had an hiv mixed with influenza and that we would be seeing a much worse pandemic in the form of avian flu. That will also knock out your food supply.

You’ve been taught the most dumbed down spin of what is going on and you have a responsibility to your fellow humans to learn more and do more.

There is no more hypnotized pre Covid era America or western world.

If you haven’t noticed it’s being destroyed right now and they’re bleeding it dry and bleeding the middle class out.

Watch the video of Dr John Coleman from 20 plus years ago on rumble and quit being lazy.

This has been going on for decades.Ok so what about things like ricin? What is the dose?Why trust what one doctor says?  Just one instead of the overall medical community?   And a hack like him?The mRNA vaccines do not change your DNA - Robert malone didn’t say that it changes your DNA either. The pharma exec also doesn’t say they needed to rebrand - you may be referring to the SEC filing below:

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1682852/000168285220000017/mrna-20200630.htmWell for sure, but it’s not because they need the money. It’s about bleeding everyone dry and forcing people into submission through losing everything.Bro this was worked out a decade ago. This is old tech and was started at DARPA. People need to start having real conversations about this if it’s going to be back talked about. Oh they got ur data alright. Once you find out what’s possible with this tech you’ll likely have the kundalini experience and just disappear. It’s not just myocarditis. It’s cancer, it’s ms, it’s Parkinson’s, it’s dementia and it’s genetic warfare on a global scale. It is not a vaccine and they are 100 percent collecting all the data trust me on that.>they 

Who's they? That specific local pharmacist in South Carolina?You're obviously young, stop being so fucking gullible. You're going to be fine, the vaccine didn't hurt you.> clots are also a part of life that anyone can get at any time.

They are finding clots that nobody had seen before.I should start using the Dim Mak on people.

If they believe this shit, they absolutely will believe I have the death touch.What caused the clot doesn't care what you "blame it on".  Ha. 
 
I'm sure the people that got cancer 20 years after Ground Zero have that same attitude (they do not)Not to spark conflict, but how is that in itself ignorant?Who cares about anecdotal evidence? The overwhelming evidence the world over makes any anecdotal evidence to the contrary absolutely worthless. 

There were zero epidemiologists - the people whose entire professional scientific career has been the study of viruses and diseases in the human body - who were opposed to the vaccine so any other opinions would categorically be considered dogshit.The burden of proof is on the commenter who claimed that the scientifically literate avoided the vaccine. My rebuttal is essentially that are no qualified experts who are opposed to the vaccine, and since you can't prove a negative, the only way to back up my claim is to prove that anyone who has claimed to be opposed to the vaccine doesn't have the qualifications needed to have an expert opinion. 

As I listed below in response to the poster who claimed to know of 5 Dr's who were opposed to the vaccine - 2 of them aren't epidemiologists, immunologists, or virologists and thus aren't qualified to give an expert opinion on the matter, 2 of the names aren't opposed to the vaccine and have actually been a proponent of it, and the last one has zero data to back them up, despite claiming that they have the data - they have never released it. Another commenter claimed that a Belgian veterinary doctor, who did have a PhD in virology, was an expert and was anti-covid vaccine, but again, that Dr's claims have been debunked by his peers and they released no data to back up their claims. 

None of these people have been censored, in fact the ones who were actually anti-vax went viral which is the opposite of being censored. 

So as of yet, no one has presented any qualified experts who base their anti-vax opinions on verifiable data.If ya' made it this long with no discernable ill effects, well by golly you may not have been killed by the hospital system. You may just've avoided people improperly handling the vaccine or got a saline solution. Too many variables.

Consider detoxing in some meaningful fashion to give yourself more of a chance. Heavy Metals, Parasites, NWO, you can manage removal of some or all of the concerns you may have. Only do so if you FEEL it necessary to do so. Trust Your Gut.

Beyond that, what is done is done. Try not to harbor resentment if possible, and if you do don't let the measure of your ire outweigh the understanding of your heart.Remember 20 years ago when everyone said cell phones would cause cancer? Now nobody thinks twice about keeping in their pocket right next to their balls.

Now so many women want to have their own lives and don't want to have children until they're financially independent. How many women you know in their 30s are still not married and have no kids?If that was their goal, why would they just not make it work better? My wife and I had 4 failed rounds of IVF before getting the vaccine. The first round we did after getting it, we all of a sudden got 7 eggs that turned into 3 viable embryos, one of which we already transferred and he’ll be one in a few weeks. I’m not saying the vaccine made us more fertile, but it definitely failed miserably at making us infertile.You are me? That's a new conspiracy here.Pureblood. My sides ;D

None, I got well tested shots that aren't therapy-ing my genes.They're not safe. Hundreds of millions of "happy meals" are served. Hundreds of millions of beverages with aspartame are sold. Doesn't mean they're safe.I will note, it's *possible* that the more severe side effects, such as blood clots, can have long term impacts. But point being, if you didn't develop a severe side effect in a short time period after getting vaccinated, it's essentially impossible for them to spontaneously arise.

And more relevantly, again, the rates that these things occur are incredibly, incredibly low. You're probably more likely to get a serious injury driving to get the vaccination, rather than from the vaccination itself.Vaccines don’t have delayed effects that pop up years later. In the extremely rare cases they do have severe effects, they happen close to (within 6 weeks) when the vaccine was administered.

It’s found in all of your bodily fluids, and “the science” does support it. You’re potentially a carrier of PRION disease and need to take action to right what you’ve done if you decided to take this.Totally wrong.

The NIH funds most medical research in the U.S. The NIH is funded by taxpayers.

Most other countries have similar structures.

You can scream “big Pharma” till your tonsils fall out. Doesn’t change the truth.Like I said, you have no idea what you're talking about.

mRNA vaccines have been under development for 30 years. VAERS reports do not establish a causal relationship between vaccination and side effects. It's a \*voluntary\* reporting system. When you have a nationwide vaccination campaign, you will, by definition, have a higher number of VAERS reports. Epidemiology 101. The CDC didn't change the overall definition of a vaccine - you're [listening to disinformation](https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-976069264061).

The vaccines are safe and effective. We have overwhelming data from every country in the world, from academic, corporate, government, and independent researchers.

Note: I didn't say they were \*perfect\*, because no vaccine is.

Get a clue: [https://www.youtube.com/@DebunktheFunkwithDrWilson](https://www.youtube.com/@DebunktheFunkwithDrWilson)So your crediting modern medicine and good doctors not necessarily a vaccineCorrection; if you got the vaccine, then YOU are the close minded one. And ya that means you absolutely do not belong on this subreddit.I ignored it because coerced is a more general verb that encompasses a number of verbs that more accurately describe what the OP said. Forced is quite simply a black and white way to describe something. He wasn't forced, he was pressured and intimidated. Coerced doesn't mean all 3 at the same time ( pressure, intimidate or force) it can be one or a combination of many verbs.Some things I will outright agree with is that pharmacy companies do not have a track record of trustworthiness and that people with dissenting opinions shouldn't be silenced. But other than him being an early contributor to mRNA research I'm unfamiliar with any recent opinions of his. As of this moment I'm more familiar with other information from the decades that the technology was in development. It was something I'd been watching closely for a long time because biotechnology is a personal interest of mine. But after I take my daughter to the park this morning I will take some time to thoughtfully read his opinions on the subject of covid vaccines. Do you have any links that would speed up my learning his stamce?That antivax sentiment is logical. I understand some people not wanting a particular vaccine for a particular reason is absolutely their right, I never agreed with vaccine mandates and I think influenza vaccines with only 30% efficacy aren't worth the risks, but adopting an all vaccines are bad position is completely discounting a century of science.Yep, I read about that sicko. But guess what, there's sickos everywhere. Schools, grocery stores, parks, and especially in churches. Blaming higher education and demonizing those who value education, would be like if I said all Christians are sick ducks because thousands of pastors and church leaders regularly engage in pedophilia.Wtf does that have to do with anything?

A "Post Plandemic World"?!  What does that even mean?!  Ok, I know what you mean, but please turn off the Youtubes and the conservative news outlets.

People have been depraved pre-pandemic and they'll be depraved long after it.  

I know we all are dealing with our own stuff, but let's face it, no one really knows how this covito stuff will play out in the future.  Both sides of the jab debate like to think they know what's going to happen because the thoughta offer a sense of solace.  But we don't know.Yeah. There were promotions in places where prostitution is legal so they bribed people with a free hour with a sex worker if you got vaccinated. 

The news station interviewed a dude and he said “I was going to get vaccinated anyway so this is a double win for me”That’s a truncated version but there were many who advised not to get it. See the Great Barrington declaration> The pharma exec also doesn’t say they needed to rebrand 

[He said the plandemic scared many people enough into taking the gene therapies.

https://www.bit **** chute.com/video/GesdwrMev2YL/ 

The fact that people were not allowed to call them gene therapies (which they are per definition) and [they changed the definition of vaccines](https://nationalfile.com/cdc-quietly-changes-definition-of-vaccine-as-covid-19-continues-to-infect-vaccinated-people/)   surely helped with that too. 

Remove spaces and ***The people carried this out print the money for the world.im not denying that. but that also doesnt mean 100% of clots are now tied to the vax. the same way they were incorrectly tying every death to covid. can’t play the same game they didA. J&J pulled their vax due to clots

B. I just linked an article that states clots can last decades. 
 
Ha, yes I'll just believe anything, ya maroon. Haha. Gtfo.you’re assumption can only be proven with time so idk why you’re running your mouth with so much confidence. come back to this thread in 20 years little broIt's never, ever safe to assume that government cares about the people.You’re parents decided you needed to take a needle in your arm  IN ORDER for the Jewish population would be considered safe.   

Your parents used holy books and trusted Rabbis over anything scientific when they made your decision for you!  


And that is ignorance.There were, all the real scientists were censored. I completely understand your point though, those who thought they knew science that isThat’s not what you said originally. You said scientifically literate. Should have stopped yah here where you shifted the goalpostsI see.... ROTFL.  

Pick the experts you want and good luck with that.  I do suggest to do some research to see if the folks you think are experts are not selling you a lie (they even may believe themselves).Yeah knowing my town, the vaccines were most likely miss handled. Thanks for reminding me that it is what it is and that no matter how much I  worry about it I cant turn back time. I will just try detoxing like you said, because there is no harm in doing so.I never said it was their goal exactly, but it sure seems to be able to cause all kinds of random problems in people - infertility being just one of them. It's a dice roll what side-effects you get or don't get, depending on the batch or whether the vaccine wasn't stored and handled properly or not. 🤷‍♂️ Some might have been lucky enough to receive doses from vials that has been stored too warm and the active ingredients destroyed, which seemed to happen in some places, or you got placebo or faulty batches.

There's really no explanation why birth rates have suddenly plummetted across the entire western world just in a couple of years. Again all people working from home many of which are STILL working a lot from home should have led to more kids being born, not less, because people were having way more sex. Just like you find stories like yours you find stories of people who suddenly became infertile after taking the vaccine, both problems with menstruation and the eggs or men having pain in their testicles and super low sperm counts. 🤷‍♂️This is the big thing. Yes, you could have had severe side effects. But if you didn't so far, you aren't going to get them in the future.What a cop out of an answer. Surely, if my questions have such universally known truths, it should trivially easy to answer them, don’t you think?

Mate, if you don’t have evidence to support your beliefs, at least admit it. Don’t act as though I’m the blind one."Funded by taxpayers"

Incredible.

DOD is also funded by taxpayers.

Do you think that corruption doesn't occur there and special interests don't bite their fangs into the financial behemoth that is the Military Industrial complex?

I love the absolute blind belief in structures. 

There's been millions of corrupt people who have benefited billions of dollars from various deals. 

It's hilarious that you don't realize that it could happen anywhere, government org or otherwise.You're trying to turn his personal experience into some kind of "Gotcha!"Did I say anything about the vac?  No I said the treatments that the hospital gave me saved by life.Force is not black or white and can also be used to describe putting pressure on something. Not just physically applying something. 

“My mom forced me to do my homework” 

That would be an example of force by pressure. You are being needlessly pedantic.https://www.amazon.com/Lies-My-Govt-Told-Me-ebook/dp/B09R4Y6YKJ/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=

His book would be an excellent start, but that would obviously be a paywalled source.

The next best source would be one of the many interviews he's done on this subject. Many of those have unfortunately already been censored from the platform they were hosted on. I would start with https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUZ7gynsoUU as a ready source still available.My point is titles and degrees have lost tremendous value over the last few years. We gave far too much credit where credit wasn't due.I may have taken you a bit seriously had you said turn off MSM news outlets but you specified conservative programs which tells me you just dont get it. I don't know what's gonna happen but I can tell you what they are trying to make happen. You have to be in deep denial or just dumb as a stump to not see what's going on.I did. I googled what dose of ricin is considered medicine and got nothing but sites telling me it's poison. No medical value what so ever unless you consider euthanasia a medical procedureThe definition of gene therapy is “the introduction of normal genes into cells in place of missing or defective ones in order to correct genetic disorders.” - how do the mRNA vaccines do this exactly?> but that also doesnt mean 100% of clots are now tied to the vax.

Nobody is claiming that.A.) no where in this chain is there a link from you. Don’t think I read every fucking comment to see your link. **Fat fucking ego** on you eh?

B.) clots **can** last decades, and can have a **myriad of causes**. Just like a death can come from any reason. Like a Dim Mak, or fucking cancer. Did the **Dim Mak give you cancer**? Did the vaxx give you blood clots? This is **causation vs correlation at work**.

If you get easily offended by things people say to others that can only VAUGLY be referred to yourself, maybe YOU are the issue.

Have a nice day. 🖕Not to make excuses, but I didn't really have a say in whether I would get the vaccine or not (I'm a minor) but I have learned a lot through this and I thank you for the reminder to not be a follower.Give me any evidence of that happening. Any shred of hard evidence that would indicate that there were virologists or epidemiologists who were against the vaccine and were silenced. 

If all that exists are 2nd hand accounts from other anti-vax sources saying it happened, then it 100% did not happen.Yeah, I'm not claiming to be an expert, nor am I pushing an unverifiable source. I'm not even saying that everyone should be vaccinated - I clearly said that there are valid reasons not get vaccinated. I'm only establishing that the actual experts, who are basing their opinions on the verifiable data, were not opposed to the vaccine.yeah just go to a doctor and get more poison lmao YOU BOTYou said Big Pharma, and you were wrong. Don’t be afraid to admit your mistake.YOU SAID number 5 ""saved"" your lifeNo you're wrong. Just because someone says they were "forced to do their homework" it's just the person exaggerating. Go read the definition of forced again. It says literally says "involuntary". If we are talking about being forced to take a vaccine then that would mean being held down and vaccinated against your will.Titles and degrees never really meant much to me. I rely on character and historical behavior to judge individuals. While o viously not everyone is evil, from the bottom to the top of society, there's terrible people everywhere.Don't choke on your presumptions.  I chose "conservative" outlets because they appear to be the only outlets willing to take the stance against the jab.  And that is by design of course.  Why would I say MSM?  They're not dissuading anyone from taking the jab.  You told on yourself by using the acronym "MSM", Mr. Conservative. lol

>I don't know what's gonna happen but I can tell you what they are trying to make happen.

What are you personally doing about what you suspect is happening?

>You have to be in deep denial or just dumb as a stump to not see what's going on.

No.  I choose not to live in fear.  I fortunately didn't take the jab.  But I'm also brave enough to admit that I haven't gotten a clear enough picture of this situation. And I for damn sure am not going to expend too much energy arguing for or against an issue when the verdict is still out on it.

The powers that be have been forcing inoculation on the masses for quite some time now.  What's the difference between let's say the polio vax and "the jab"?    Legit question, even if it does come off a bit cheeky.Sounds like you answered your own question.  Brava> One of the definitions of gene therapy is...

[FTFY.](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/rs5ooh/95_of_the_omicron_cases_in_germany_are_fully/hqls99g/)You sound mature. The other commenter possibly just means that your parents’ reasoning re: Israel and vaccination sounds very flawed.I too appreciate your response.   My views on all this stuff is evolving as well.  

I guess I can say this, our body autonomy is the most important thing to remember.   

Cheers and i wish you well. :-)Geeet Vanden Bossche. Expert in virology and vaccines. Opposed the MRNA vaccines.I googled your question and am able to find multiple people> actual experts

Actual experts, or sales people and buyers of their crap?There's no fear. 

Attempting to know the extent of how deep the web goes is pointless. 

I know there are corrupt fucks, NIH is closely intermingled with the same companies that they're supposed to be an oversight of. 

The conflict of interest is so high that pretending it doesn't exist is to dig your head in the sand.Yes, and it was regarding oxygen incubators and a medication called Remdesivir, which is not a vaccine but an anti-viral medication. 

The vacs were a joke and rushed.No. I’m not

Force- 

: to compel by physical, moral, or intellectual means

Do you really not know what synonyms are? You literally acknowledged that there can be multiple definitions of coercion. But that’s not the case with force?With that said what's your take on Fauci?So you agree that the person's about all poisons being medicine comment is bullshit?The first link in your link is the exact SEC filing that I reference in my post above. It says 

“Currently, mRNA is considered a gene therapy product by the FDA. Unlike certain gene therapies that irreversibly alter cell DNA and could act as a source of side effects, mRNA-based medicines are designed to not irreversibly change cell DNA; however, side effects observed in gene therapy could negatively impact the perception of mRNA medicines despite the differences in mechanism. In addition, because no product in which mRNA is the primary active ingredient has been approved, the regulatory pathway for approval is uncertain. The number and design of the clinical trials and preclinical studies required for the approval of these types of medicines have not been established, may be different from those required for gene therapy products, or may require safety testing like gene therapy products. Moreover, the length of time necessary to complete clinical trials and to submit an application for marketing approval for a final decision by a regulatory authority varies significantly from one pharmaceutical product to the next, and may be difficult to predict.”

So how are the mRNA vaccines classed as gene therapy products?His argument was flawed, his peers did not agree with his opinions, and he's actually a veterinary doctor, not a human doctor. He does have a PhD in virology, but he is literally the only one, out of thousands, that came to that conclusion. 

He wasn't censored either. He was just wrong. 

 https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/covid-19-critical-thinking-pseudoscience/doomsday-prophecy-dr-geert-vanden-bosscheYou are a liar.

What you found was epidemiologists saying that the vaccine could be useless if the virus continued to mutate. That is not the same as saying "don't get vaccinated".

If you had found actual sources you would have linked them.

Nice try.None of the actual experts are selling anyone anything. What even would they be trying to sell? The free vaccine? The individual experts don't even have name recognition unlike the louder anti-vax people who are marketing vitamins and treatments.

Who is more trustworthy - the dude on conservative radio or youtube telling you that he has a special mix of all natural ingredients, including colloidal silver and 10,000% of your daily vitamin C - that will kill the virus immediately, but you can only buy his treatment in a bottle of 60 pills for $60/bottle if you buy a 3 month subscription up front.

Or

The Dr. that says "get vaccinated for free, stay hydrated, avoid infecting other"

Hmmm 🤔 I just don't know who is more trustworthyI thought you meant booster 5. What the frick is number 5?Guy has absolutely profited off of the positions he has held over the years which automatically lumps him into the same group in my mind as many corrupt politicians. As far as his actions during Covid, I don't think he was really in charge, so much as the public face. Fauci didn't have the power to absolve pharmaceutical companies of liability, or give emergency authorization to an admittedly under-tested vaccine, powers like that were above Fauci's head and resided within congress and Whitehouse executive action. And I want to preface upfront that I really dislike the current clown, Biden, there was another Bozo in charge of everything during operation Warp Speed and the covid pandemic.>Polio was a real threat.

What is "real" to you?

How do we know that polio was not created in a lab?Swiss physician and chemist Paracelsus expressed the basic principle of toxicology: “All things are poison and nothing is without poison; only the dose makes a thing not a poison.”> “Currently, mRNA is considered a gene therapy product by the FDA.

So, they are gene therapy per definition, exactly like i said.I was connected with him on LinkedIn before he was censored. I watch it happen. 

You are a liar, and you're a progressive nazi too.Martin Kulldorff, Robert Malone, Marty Makary, Peter McCullough, Scott Atlas….

I mean google

LolAh, a semantic game used as a straw man argument.  Creative, LOL.Sorry I was responding to a different comment when I said number five because that guy had a list of different treatments.He’s got brain rot don’t listen to him. These folks will do anything to say the vaccines are everything I but what they are: gene therapy.A progressive, as you called me, is a Leftist and thus cannot be a Nazi or a fascist because those are  strictly Right Wing ideologies. JFC learn what words mean before you use them.

Also, you have presented zero proof for your claims from LinkedIn. Who the fuck are you that you think anyone should just take your word without any evidence?

You sound like a fucking boomer demanding to be respected and not questioned.Do you even know who those people are and what they said?

Kulldorff was a member of the Vaccine Safety Technical subgroup of CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. In April 2021, he disagreed with the CDC's pause of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine rollout and argued publicly that the vaccine's benefits outweighed clotting risks, particularly for older people.

Malone was never censored, but his peers wrote an open letter condemning his misinformation to Spotify after his Joe Rogan interview. He has never cited a single study to corroborate his opinions, despite saying that he had studies to support his claims. So obviously he's a liar.

Makary isn't against the vaccine, he is a proponent of it. He was also a proponent of wearing masks. He has only ever been against mandating the vaccine.

Peter McCullough is a cardiologist and isn't qualified to have an expert opinion on vaccines or viruses.

Scott Atlas is a radiologist, also not qualified to have an expert opinion on vaccines or viruses.

2 of the 5 people you listed aren't opposed to the vaccine, another 2 aren't qualified to give an expert opinion on the matter, and 1 claimed to have data that backed up his opinions but never produced it.

Also none of these people were censored. 

I mean Google. 

Lol. 

So do you have anyone who was actually opposed to the vaccine and who actually has data to back them up, is qualified to have an expert opinion, and has been censored? Like an epidemiologist or virologist as I originally asked for?OK. Name a single expert who is selling the public anything regarding covid.Ok I don't disagree with treating covid, I'm glad you didn't get the vaccine and realize how stupid it was. This was a  misunderstandingTake a quick glance at this guy's post history to see how he feels about conspiracies.

Astroturfing all the way down.1) This is a clear example of shifting the goalposts, based on your opinions on authority only. Literally a strawman

2) This whole thread started with you saying you’d have to be ignorant to think the scientifically literate avoided the vaccine, ad hominem

3) You’re still ignorant for thinking the scientifically literate did not avoid the vaccine, and I don’t really care to prove it using compromised search engines during my free time> Name a single expert who is selling the public anything regarding covid.

Birx and Fauci for instance.Not true. I only do that to the bullshit conservative propaganda that gets posted without any conspiracy theories included because that shit doesn't belong here.What product is Fauci selling? All I've found is disproven claims about his stock holdings. 

The only product I could find that Birx could be tied to was an air filter company, ActivePure, she started working at 15 months after the covid outbreak began, which does market itself as making filters that can filter out the airborne covid virus. But she hasn't had a public statement about that or covid since she went back into the private sector.

So how exactly are they selling the public anything to enrich themselves?New Cleveland Clinic Study Confirms Negative Efficacy of Covid Vaccine: Boosted 33% MORE Likely to Get Covid###[Meta] Sticky Comment

Add it to the pile

We knew this way back they jabbed everyone

South Korea saw record high case numbers, despite 99% mask compliance and 85% of their entire population being vaccinated, which is odd because I’ve been told by CNN experts that masks prevent infections and that an 85% vaccination rate would get us past COVID https://i.imgur.com/syqfbf6.jpgMeta sticky comment:

When an account that basically lives on another sub and just so happens to pop up on a covid post exposing the bullshit lies told for years, only to discount the post exposing the lies - that's a pharma or DOD shill.Why is everything else blamed for whatever ailments effecting people besides vaccines?For example rise in cancer, low sperm counts in men, autism, heart problems/attacks, and so on, why is everything except vaccines ever pointed at to be causing this, for example, air pollution, micro plastics in water, gardening, video games, unhealthy diet and so on. I’m not saying none of those are contributing factors, my question is why is the constant barrage of vaccines never included? Never is it ever suggested in any mainstream scientific research any of the 72 vaccines now require in this day and age to be the culprit in any health issues. Never mind just the covid vaccine, but all the others constantly injected into children the moment they leave the womb.###[Meta] Sticky Comment

But have an unlisted adverse reaction to the shots and you’re lucky if the *medical* staff report it let alone the news media. And even then the person gets doused in mitigation and cries for ‘sources’ and appeals to authority. How does that work when the authorities don’t care or help you or report it?

If it’s Covid, the powers that be advocate for you. If it’s the shots, you’re on your own navigating the seedy underbelly of the medical system that is vaccine injury.Because the goal is to implement regular shots to genetically edit people and kill off the population.

They can’t have vaccines be the cause of anything even though there is a correlation with their usage and many health problems.

Institutions are captured. Remember that.Because all of these trends were already increasing before 2021You know the answer. Big pharma has all the money to influence media and the medical industry, and they’ve *ahem* made a killing off vaccines for as long as we can remember. Anti-backers get silenced as well… I was talking shit in the science subreddit for a while over all the dumb shit in there, my first comment on vaccines, I was instantly banned forever. 

Think of Plato’s Allegory of the Cave.The powers that be (TPTB), including Gates have said over and over that they want to reduce the world's population. Vaccinations, especially Covid vaccine have been doing a great job doing this. Do you really think they want people to wise up to the extermination protocols they've developed?Why are you blaming vaccines and not the debilitating effects of COVID in the short and long term as studies say?So do you live under a rock or are you pretending to have never heard of people blaming vaccines for stuff?People who know nothing whatsoever about the immune system think they can become "experts" on vaccines by reading websites. BOOOOOOO!I was in a U.K hospitals today for an X-ray, as I had major surgery 6 weeks ago and I asked a guy why he was in, apparently he got a blood infection from his 7th covid jab, I’ll bet it’s his immune system shutting down but he wasn’t taking me on when I said I was anti covid jab.Cancer, sperm count, and heart problems are all because people are fucking obese.

I would sooner believe autism is related to the BMI of the mother than vaccines.Because the antivax really got going when a doctor falsified data to make the mmr shot look bad so that his shares in the companies that produced the other vaccines didn't go lose value. It was *literally* a big pharma conspiracy and you all bought the lie and fucking ran with it.Absolutely. It’s so wild how vaccine injured people have no one in a position of power to help them bother to advocate for them. Medical professionals scoff at them, politicians, health officials, institutions in charge of health policy all, for the most part, write them off. For the most part it’s all ignored, or they are given reasons or possibilities for their medical problems being anything and everything except for vaccines.Oh were there.

Thanks for the propaganda.Yeah I know it’s so weird how questioning vaccines is such a taboo topic. Like why is it such a huge deal to question the legitimacy of them. If they, as in all vaccines, were so safe and studied so vigorously, you think the response would be to link the blind studies done on all vaccines instead of shutting down the conversation before it even begins. Just that alone raises a red flag. You’d think they’d love to cite this study and that study to prove the efficacy and safety and legitimacy. Hmmm maybe there is no study?? Could that be why??What kind of studies do you mean?Damn how'd you find your way to this sub? Your handler point you this way?Because that's a crock of shit, and you are trying to distract from the reality that doctors have come out saying how terrible the COVID vaccines are.I’m asking why they aren’t included in most messaging or looked at as a possible culprit. It’s always this that and the other thing, that’s the problem for this that and the other ailments, but never do they dare question all of these newly added vaccines every decade that keep getting added in a time when sanitation, nutrition and all other modern advances that are available this day and age to keep people healthy. It’s always vaccinate more more and more, instead of promoting eat healthier, exercise, keep living area clean etc.Plenty of people do, but nothing from the scientific community that should be studying this or presenting blind studies that conclude one way or the other.Doctors are not taught what are in vaccines. Ask your doctor what kind of training and education they got on vaccines. You’d be surprised> *People who know nothing whatsoever about the immune system*

Like u?I did develop a horrible adverse reaction to my second initial Covid shot. I can tell you the medical community - unless a doctor of immunology, and maybe virology - is not well versed in less common vaccine risks. A ton of lost trust in the medical community could have been prevented if, in the wake of a new and experimental highly reactogenic shot being both rolled out and mandated internationally, the medical community had been required to refresh their own awareness of things that would be presenting to them in some shot recipientsAh yeah America was so full of sperm and had no cancer or heart disease issues before 2021. Don't listen to the propaganda listen to me lying about how healthy we were in the 2010sLol, pointing out long-term trends is “propaganda”? Are you 12, or do you have a traumatic brain injury? I’m trying to figure out how someone can be so belligerently stupid.There have dozens of studies done on just autism and vaccines alone. And not a single relationship has been found.God forbid someone has a different opinionWell we can now see the point of this thread. Not to ask any real questions, just to pontificate about something you haven't looked into.As well as medical school education in recognizing known less common vaccine side effects. I had 2 doctors and 6 nurses *learn* that what happened to me was something a vaccine could even do, from seeing it happen to me.I did get an A+ on my vaccine design project in grad school, but I'm not an expert in immunology. I'm merely highly proficient in the subject.Hopefully you have or will get better. 

I know quite a few that have been injured. Still treating their problems currently. It’s a shame what has happened. Trust is definitely broken with a lot of folks.> Ah yeah America was so full of sperm

The decline in population seems to be a big issue among first world countries over the last ten years, that's why it the idea that the government is trying to kill off it's own citizens never really made sense to meNobody said these conditions didn't exist previously did they?

They said that these conditions have increased since the experiment.

Do try to pay attention and keep up...lolPointing out without anything to back it up is propoganda.

Now run along and watch the news so you know what to think...lolHere.  I’ll add the /s you missed.Rich fat people don't want as many kids and physically can't have as many kids.lol, yes, anyone who doesn’t agree with you “free-thinkers” is obviously a media stooge. Good luck out there. It can’t be easy.What? Rich people have a bunch kids all the time just cuz they can. Elon Musk has like 7 of them. Eddie Murphy has 10. Nick Cannon has like 12.

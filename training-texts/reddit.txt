Reddit censorship?I just watched this appear in the conspiracy sub for a quick moment and it was gone. Why?

It’s complicated because the adults are not cooperating with investigation. In addition, the area of ‘ southie’ Boston, has an even more horrific history. Stay tuned once the story develops there will be loss in humanity.  Those poor kids!https://www.bostonherald.com/2023/06/19/four-kids-found-hidden-in-filthy-south-boston-apartment-where-a-man-died/>Four children living in squalid conditions while being hidden from first responders were found in an apartment filled with “alcohol, drugs, sex toys” and a dead man, according to an incident report and outraged officials.

Any comment?I bet it would be uncensored if the party was straightSS: noticed this posted in conspiracy and was gone in the next minute. Seems like it was removed.I posted it Monday and it was removed. There is NOTHING about this in the Boston media. Doesn't fit the filthy trans/Pride narrative.What the actual fuck why isn’t this making national headlines?!?Omg saw this post there and didn't click it. Thanks for reposting the linkLol that source added “transgender”. Source article mentions no such thing.Child exploitation has a massive history in Southie (that area of Boston) its a poor area and due we all know the common theme of the Roman Catholic priests preying on children. The most impoverished areas are usually their main hunting grounds because the parents will look the other way due to negligence and or belief in the church.The police aren’t concerned these kids may be sex trafficked? It’s sad the climate the worlds created, police probably afraid to do their jobs because they’d be harassed with being transphobic

What ever the agenda was. They’ve won. This world is nuts and a fuckin shit show.Yeah, there are evil forces on the move for sure trying to corrupt society.Every sub is hella censored. Example; tv show subs. You literally aren’t allowed to voice any opinion on a character being discussed by fans or shippers if it is deemed “negative”. Even if you are being civil and not using foul language. Reddit is a giant communist site. I just use it for tips on the darkweb and other taboo interests of mine. Other than that, Reddit is full of a bunch of left wing nuts and is worthlessThe balance of evil controls those in power.  You might get banned for speaking out against Pedos here on Reddit.I do know that turtle boy news has had all kinds of lawsuits filed against him in order to try and silence his reporting. I believe he has won most of not all. He has been the downfall of a few public figures in his area and hundreds of complete dirtbags/pedos/grifters/scammers. He names and shames with no hesitation once he has the proofBwhahahahah...*takes breathe*.....bwhahahahaha......head on over to superstonk and ask about reddit censorship.  Financial experts and autists constantly have their insights censored.So it’s the dad 

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12223171/First-responders-horrified-children-trans-drag-party-dead-body-drugs-sex-toys.htmlIt’s likely due to the source lacking transparency in general. Plenty of reputable publications are now reporting the story and not being censored.Things that make you go.. hmmmmmmmmmmThe local news here in metro Boston and Boston area is barely talking about this!Is this the world you guys want to live in? First YouTube, Twitter then Insta and Reddit.. They are banning us for debating a forced narrative and there is no stopping themYa, If I attempt to approach any controversial subject matter, the autobot kills my post before it can be seen by anyone . . whats up with that?It’s being covered up, because the people were trans. Trans people are people and can do bad things like anyone else.Just a reminder that priests have down way more fowl shit to minors than you’re fixation on trans people. Going after Catholics would do far more for young children.I decline to turn off my ad blockers (I have several). What does the article say?I wonder if there’s more to this story?You got a link that isnt littered with ads?Is anyone surprised? I don't think there is another platform which is  leaning in defence of p e d o s like reddit. And i am not even exaggerating,  things i have seen over the years when it came to this, and people would get banned for highlighting that, instead of mods that would defend it. I mean the G word was banned, and using it can get you banned, what else is there to say?This post is bigoted and racist. Here’s why- Race is mentioned. Twice. Both City Council Members are quoted as referencing Juneteenth and Black peoples. Why would the author put that unnecessary and unrelated information in his article if not to try to make this also about race. One could report the story without mentioning the ethnicities, skin color, race and/or attire of any of the parties because it doesn’t matter …unless the author wants it to matter! Clearly he wants to make this a race and gender identity issue along with a drug and possible pedo issue.It’s a challenge for redditors to criticize pedophiles without condemning the entire LGBT community as “transgender grooming pedos”. The comments were probably full of those people spewing hate at everyone rather than at the culprits. 
Also this is the worst “news” site I have ever laid eyes on + this is an opinion piece not a news article.Talk about false flag to fit the transphobic agenda. Much like that school shooting not too long ago where Melissa Joan Hart just so happened to be nearby and came to the rescue. I agree that there’s a conspiracy here but yall are just playing into it bc you’re bigots.Why did the author find it necessary to embellish in the title? Isn't the truth of one dead guy enough? He had a heart attack and croaked in the middle of their drag queen party. There were drugs and dildos found in the apartment. Honestly why wouldn't the adult shield the kids from seeing a dead guy by keeping them in the bedroom? Lying about any detail undermines any impact the story was supposed to have.Much of the bullshit in this thread should be censored by the mods. Do you think maybe it's just mods doing their job?At least the turtle is gone, best news I've heard all weekIt's like the book 1984 where double-speak has already been enacted (Truth speech is deemed "hate speech") and everyone is going along with it, like sheep....What happened?In Washington DC this week, it’s so bittersweet seeing all the vibrancy, reverence and history knowing there are very dark forces at play.

Arlington National Cemetery will absolutely hit you in the feels. So many laid down their lives for what this country was supposed to be. 

That’s not a knock on the alternative lifestyles, or wanting some version of ‘Man in the High Castle’ but the petty ‘no discussion or compromise’ shit is so out of control. 

Sat at a Crystal City bar last night and watched two grown-ass adults almost come to blows over a minor difference of political opinion.isn’t it obvious what they don’t want seen?THIS IS A TEST:  I am a proud cisgender person!I’ve posted it twice and it’s gotten removed twice.Because the article is written with a tone of clear bigotry. For example, one could report the story without mentioning the ethnicities, skin color, race and/or attire of any of the parties because it doesn’t matter …unless the author wants it to matter! Clearly he wants to make this a race and gender identity issue along with a drug and possible pedo issue.I’m from Boston and haven’t seen this covered in the news at all. Only in websites. This is disgusting.I posted it to Boston subreddit and was permanently banned within 30 secondsI realized how bad it was during Covid. Holy shit they censored so many posts and comments from regular people. Never been so down voted in my (Reddit) lifeYup. I just got a ban for hate speech. I said kids shouldn't be involved in drag shows or beauty pagentsYep and the ban anyone that oppresses it.Reddit is just another arm of the democratic propaganda machineMany times when I try to upvote certain things considered right of center I get a “failed to upvote try again later” error.Exactly also the 2 letter agencies surely monitor/ post and comment on all conspiracy type subs there are. Silly to think notIf the people busted had been wearing MAGA hats, this story would be all over the news.What’s the even more horrific history? Asking for someone who grew up thereMSM is propaganda. It is all owned by the same people who own most of the government and every major news org has cia that will not allow anything but the agendaI said exactly this on the other thread. This is now a protected class of people. Why?TikTok, now that’s what I’m talking about!It probably triggered a janny that wears programmer socks lol.

In all seriousness of was probably removed so the sub doesn't get shutdown due to comments that break the ToS. That sub is constantly brigaded, trolled, etc...

But then again I made a comment on a thread once that got edited to  "[Removed by Reddit Administration]" and got me a week long ban and no message from staff. That was pretty interesting and had to do with the subject of that article, specifically how hormones are making people violently insane along with pornography. I guess I was over the target or something because I was temp banned without a reason from all of Reddit.

Someday the jannys are going to come for me lol.The only narrative is that trans and gay people are “filthy” and must be eradicated. This is the new thing just like Obama being a noncitizen Antichrist was another thing, it’s what the right focuses on instead of foreign policy or economics or health care.What would you like them to report guy ? 

Random guys with random kids maybe trans maybe they are the kids parents maybe in drag but one guy died …

You don’t just report B/S because people in this sub will scream that it’s being covered up by the gov or media or whoever the boogeyman is to them this week .The source article doesn’t use the word transgender but they were implying they were at least in drag.The source article referenced title is referring to what EMTs said about men in wigs.Men in drag, transgender, same degenerate pileSource article says it right in the headlines lolSource for these stats in southie…Censorship.  Control .  Most people don't question it which is what they are counting on.The doesn’t say they were trans though. Just one of the guys was wearing a wig when he opened the door.Every time something like this comes up somebody always has to bring up the priests.  What does one thing have to do with the other?  If I kill someone can I use the defense that some other guy killed way more people than me so what I did is not that bad?Go after priests who dress up as ladies🤔Chunks from it


“This is sickening,” said At-Large City Councilor Michael Flaherty. “I was informed by people at the scene that there were drugs, alcohol, sex toys all around the apartment as well as a dead body on the floor.”

“The apartment was in extremely unsanitary conditions. Approximately 6 adults, who appeared to be males, were seen in the apartment,” they wrote, saying they subsequently found “four children in the back bedroom being hidden by an adult male from first responders.”

According to the incident report the children ranged from ages 5 to 10.

“All of the adult parties were being uncooperative and did not provide helpful information. All adults present denied having children inside the apartment,” they wrote.https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12223171/First-responders-horrified-children-trans-drag-party-dead-body-drugs-sex-toys.htmlThe dead body was a trans black womenThis post aged like milk, lol.  Bigots may be out rages by a drag party filled with drugs, sex toys and kids, but so am I.  This isn’t a “false flag”, it’s a bunch of deranged people exposing kids to things they shouldn’t see.You have to be fucking kidding me….I don’t believe in censorship of newsCensor on the internet? Go outside bro. Live in censorship thereZero bigotry.  Just the facts . Sorry that they are inconvenient to you.A few individuals own most of the media and they control the natrative.  People need to wake up and question why they don't want you to talk about certain topics, this topic being one of them.Looks like all the paid down vote bots are gone 🥸Bro they got me too. Someone tried telling me there are hundreds of genders and I asked them how do you define each and every one of those hundreds genders (politely calling bullshit) and I got banned from subs I'm not even following lol. It's wild man. Like I said before we're living in clown world now so anything goes I guess. Just pick a random sub and type "men don't menstrate" and see how many bans you get from subs you don't even fuck withThey know it's just code for "I hating kiddie diddlers". You're not fooling anyone.BASED OPINION.
Child Drag Shows and Beauty Pageants are literally so fucked up-
The chemicals in the makeup-
The stress for a child
Exploitation by Parent
Kid diddlers-
Like bro what the fuck>I said kids shouldn't be involved in drag shows or beauty pagents

Isn't this like the parents decision?

Would you show a similar outbreak if someone brought their kid to a hiphop concert where 99% naked women are twerking on stage?There’s nothing sexual about performance art that displays over sexualized attributes of the opposite sexAll of our media seems to resemble Pravda in the 60s,70s and 80s.Once most people realize mainstream media and “alternative media” are both ultimately controlled by the elite trying to push a narrative, then we can actually get down to business.News flash - its ALL propaganda, reddit is banning people left and right.

the internet is dead.Sexaulity has always been a protected classI got a week long ban for mentioning the known, documented negative side effects of pub blockers that was removed by Reddit.I honestly think the shilling is worse in this sub than conspiracy.America is crazy... I'd think

"Cross dressing party ends with a fatal overdose whilst numerous children under the age of 11 are at the residence "

would be make a compelling headline.Well imo, if it involves even the slightest allegation of harm to children, and even if it’s spun bullshit, vetting it to find out the truth BECAUSE it involves children, it absolutely should be front page news. As well as a proper “this was bullshit” follow up if that’s the case. Considering the amount of f*ck all normally reported, it’s kinda concerning you’d have a problem with reporting on potential harm to kids.. I mean wouldn’t you like to know if in fact, the trans narrative was actual bullshit or not? Instead of shitting on someone’s easily understood concern for abuse of children?Men in wigs does not mean transgender 🤯Just as you have told someone else, throwing it right back at you. “..then hate away you, sad little man”This is the source article. Reading is important.

It’s pretty well known. You could have looked this up based purely on the keywords (Roman Catholic sexual abuse Boston/south Boston) in my initial comment. Lmao 🤣https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12223171/First-responders-horrified-children-trans-drag-party-dead-body-drugs-sex-toys.html

The dead body was a black trans woman“and found a horrifying scene filled with men in drag” it’s plural, not singular."Multiple sources tell the Herald some of the adults were dressed as women when first responders arrived at the scene."They also never bring up the environment with the statistically highest number of abuse... public schools.Because it’s absolutely hilarious that this sub only decided to pay attention to one(trans). It’s also funny how this sub claims to not be affected by msm or other forms of media and treks their own way. Yet they’re all focused on this outrage with beer, drag shows, target pretty much because kid rock and some other former celebs told them too. It’s absolute hilarious how this sun tries to say they’re critical thinkers meanwhile most here definitively are not. The exact way this subs follows popular culture with its posts prove this.[here ya go!](https://imgur.com/t/not_a_drag_queen)Ohhh! That topic! Yes, I read a different article about that earlier.

Thank you so much!!!The dead body was literally a trans black woman

It was literally impossible to use reddit during 2020-22I got banned from a “pregnant” subreddit while I was pregnant because I commented on a “prolife” postTruth.

Well, you are wrong. Gender is 100% a social construct.Yes,  this does raise a good question though.  Where's the line? What is the point where a parents wishes should be considered harmful to a child?Please write your congress-person and Senator, let them know how you feel.  
I wrote mine yesterday and sent it.  I told her the Pravda part. I also asked how much prison time would "I" get if I tried to get out of paying tax on 1.5 million.  


Bidens corruption stuff coming. What what happens when "It's beyond the statute of Limitations"?  


I also let her know that I for one have lost all confidence in our government.  


our Government looks no better than the following crime families. 

Bonanno  
Colombo  
Gambino  
Genovese  
Lucchese

I'm surprised the Clinton Clan's not up there.Alternative? Some yes, but its the last bastion of press in this countryIt's some sad shit isn't it. When you realize how far ahead technologically the gov is than the people you see how easily it would be to replace most of the internet with bots and completey manipulated information. knowledge is power and knowledge is censored from us "for our own good".All pharmaceuticals are safe, especially pub blockers and vaccines.  Consume as much as you can.One thing I like about conspiracy is the fact I get news there that isn’t seen in other places but this isn’t cool. News should not be censoredIt is but they are so easy to pick out and aren’t very good at what they do. Have some fun with themBut it hasn’t been confirmed . It’s a article that was reposted with extra comments and thoughts . 

What do you want ?Nowhere does it say the children were abused .. 

If I had a bunch of followers and read something about you and just posted it without looking into it do you think anyone would really care if days / weeks later I corrected it and said it was bullshit ? 

No, the damage and anger was already done and your life could be destroyed .I understand that but the other “news” source clearly doesn’t.same shit to the unindoctrinated

i don't have to know all of your wicked terms to know the deeds are wicked.  you're playing a game & everybody losesDo they have to publicly come out as transgender to be considered trans?Yeah I’m just noting what they’re likely referring toThis gender ideology is becoming bewildering.The uneducated think everything is wholesome and not sexual at all at Pride family friendly events.

Edcuate yourself, because that is no excuse for ignorance :

If you think they are ok, I assume you're all for sexualising children.To the normal and moral people of the world.No one had a problem with it until they involved children. But I guess you're just another groomer“Multiple reports told the herald some of the adults were dressed as women” reading the whole article is importantCorrect. Drag is not trans. Not only that, a wig is hardly considered drag. Maybe he was bald and just wanted lovely flowing locks?It’s because they’re a protected class.Kid Rock should be capitalized! Please, it’s important for the “awakened folks”!Ik there have been lots of cases of religious catholic figures of authority assaulting and raping children but what about the general catholic community are just regular people and “going after catholics” would accomplish nothingSo mentioning race is bigotry? Not merely a statement of fact? How is it unnecessary or unrelated? A bunch of weirdo dudes partying hard with children on premise - one dying - I think you’re missing the point while crying “bigotry”

Does it seem weird to you that city counsel are virtue signaling rather than addressing an absolutely abomination happening in this city? 

Are you suggesting bigotry in the Op Ed turtle boy piece or the source article from the a herald?They used bots and they paid real people also, or they were just government employees who set up Reddit accounts. I remember when I started noticing it was a systemic effort, I would look at the profiles of these generic commenters (who were unnaturally upvoted for simple comments) and they were always less than two months old. I was looking for established Reddit accounts (3,5,10 years old) with lots of karma and good reputation that were blindly promoting vaccines, and it was pretty rare. Of course a lot of people fell for the scam but they all just repeated the same thing and could never refute the “conspiracies”. Never again ignore your gut, that’s what they want. They want you to question what you see and believe with your own eyes.Yea man deff. I remember for years talking about how even though I was a child back then, I still miss pre 9/11 culture... These days Id be happy just to have pre covid culture again. Covid really brought out all the crazies. I guess at the very least covid taught us who the real Nazis areThere’s plenty of good “mainstream” journalists. That word has been totally bastardized. See the ICIJ. It’s a tactic by the elite to discredit legitimate journalists that are connected to a “mainstream” body. Just like they do if a serious journalist associates with a  more “alternative” media body. Mainstream journalism is much more boring too, but the world biggest conspiracies are exposed there daily, so the common person won’t pay attention to it.

“Alternative” journalists like Weinstein or Hancock are important but are important for introducing hypothesis or threads and trying to make connections while more serious “mainstream” journalists (like the ICIJ) take those hypothesis and turn them into certified connections.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Consortium_of_Investigative_Journalists

PBS also has actual in depth journalism as well, but good god is it boring. Brooks and Shields used to be the big exciting climax to the show. A serious actual conservative with legitimate ideas and arguments against a likewise liberal.Best if you inject them directly in your ovaries and/or testicles, assuming you still have any.Yes. In fact for the rest of your life! We will take your money too. But you’re fine! Society thinks you’re coolMore like you get fed propaganda and eat it up with a silver spoon while saying thank you LOLSo you're telling me everything posted via the MSM has been confirmed?being around drugs and sex toys IS abuse, what’re you talking about?!I guess my point being, true or false, if children are involved in any capacity, I think finding out their safety and well being is paramount above all other concerns. Even if no abuse occurred, I would hope the adults are the children’s parent or direct family members, cuz if not.. wtf you doin there then?If there were no children involved, then I’d absolutely agree with you. But if there is, isn’t it appropriate to run that f*clear down and find out wtf the deal is? And possibly exonerate said damage already done?No. But one doesn’t imply the other.Is wearing a wig all it takes to be considered trans?If everyone was normal life would be very boring. People should embrace their oddities.No one had a problem with the dead bodies until they involved children? Where do you come up with this? Right because anyone who disagrees with you or proves you wrong must be a groomer.Dressed as women does not mean transgender lolDressing as a woman, or the opposite sex, doesn’t make you transgender. Comprehension, is important too.Yeah, and all that article did was regurgitate what the Boston Herald article said, along with adding their own commentary. They even link it in the article. No new information was actually reported.Turtle Boy is a bastion of truthYou’re embarrassing yourself my dude.Drag is just a smaller investment.Non binary is trans we don’t know how they identify tbhTheir not trans until they identify as trans?? When should we announce what they want to be seen as??Weak try. Race is superfluous to the story. We don’t know the race of the perpetrators, but we know two Council members were celebrating Juneteenth at some other location in an unrelated story. How is that relevant unless you are racist and trying to insinuate that the perpetrators are Black. Even if they are in fact Black, what does that have to do with anything? Are you suggesting we should prosecute Black suspects differently than those of other colors or ethnicities/races?>they paid real people also, or they were just government employees 

I would really love to see all these people lined up [holding signs blatantly confessing what they do for a living
](https://i.imgur.com/H7leLUh.jpg)

Can you imagine getting paid to sit all day at a computer insulting & contradicting logical normal people??




I've never understood the concept of sociopaths so well until I accidentally ended up dating a couple of sociopaths. They really do have no soul and no conscience. They will do anything for money and they feel absolutely no remorse for destroying other people's lives for their own financial gain. It is absolutely astounding. I'm not joking when I say if they got a brain scan, their prefrontal cortex would be severely underdeveloped compared to those of us who do have a conscience.I agree 100% I live in Canada & it is an entire shit show.Marxist ideologies can only be implemented by force, and the usual prerequisite is societal collapse of some kind. People won't go for something so extreme unless extreme conditions are already upon them.Except we did *not* give the state power to censor people on social media. In fact, it's long-established Constitutional law that they *cannot* do that. But, starting in the Obama administration, they began to do it anyway. See the Twitter files for more.I think its partially because we gave power to the state. Once the government gets an extra taste in power, its very difficult for it to give it back. It takes a principled and ethically mature society to make the transition back and forth. Given today’s political climate, i expect it to continue to escalate. 

People no longer want to hear the other side anymore, we have become a culture of echo chambers. Which i dont have to explain why its extremely dangerous for a country that prides itself in “freedom” and as democracy to become like this.Well it's your personal freedom how you sexually identify, so yes?That should show you how much I distrust mainstream mediaIt’s easy to spot propaganda in any article these days🙄 yeah sure . So is that your way of saying if you can’t beat them join them or …THANK YOU!!!!! ffs… you’re actually arguing if there was abuse in an environment where all this shit happens???What sex toy was there ? What drugs ? Like wtf . 

The link that was posted above is a repost of another post . The post above had things added that is more or less a “ what if “ 

The only thing that is certain is that a guy died after the cops / ambulance was called . 

If you’re hanging out with other dudes doing drugs with kids present than I would assume the cops would have arrested and taken the kids into protective services . 

Why wouldn’t the article have that information ? Don’t you think If they had time to speculate about what may have been on scene that they would have also put in the article that the people were arrested and the kids saved ? 

No ? Not making senseI agree and also would think that the article would have added that kinda big part of the story . Kids were saved from drugged up men / family . 

Guess my point is the story is so horribly written that it’s logical to think it’s b/s made to get people upset .I essentially already stated my point which I don’t know why I got downvoted for; unless it’s by someone that disagrees trans and drag are different. We don’t even know how they identify, we just know they were people that “appeared to be men” and that a man wearing a wig was claiming to be the father of the kids. The second news article just claims they are transgender to get more attention and outrage.It's called context. Men in wigs, drugs, sex toys. Sounds like a whole lotta scum to meI mean usually all it takes is a switcheroo of pronouns and genders right? 

Unless it’s a hair piece.You can be odd and individualistic without being a degenerateLeaves the kids alone and idgaf.

Go and watch some of the "family friendly" pride videos on twitter.

Lots of bdsm, dildo sucking "whilst dildo is on a person", whipping, etc.

Are these videos OK? Or are you excusing the clear sexualisation of children? It's one or the other...

Do whatever you want as an adult, but if you wanna live a life of perversion, keep the children out of it.What does it mean then, el maestro?No, but it does mean child abuse. Absolutely disgusting and vile!*Reading* *is* *fundamental*
Did you even read your own rebuttal post. I think you're the one who should be embarrassed. FROM YOUR OWN LINK:

"Four children living in squalid conditions while being hidden from first responders were found in an apartment filled with “alcohol, drugs, sex toys” and a dead man, according to an incident report"


"Flaherty, Public Safety chairman on the council, told the Herald Monday night the dead body found on the floor was “from an apparent overdose” and that “a man wearing a wig claiming to be the father” of the kids was found in a back bedroom."


"Approximately 6 adults, who appeared to be males, were seen in the apartment,” they wrote, saying they subsequently found “four children in the back bedroom being hidden by an adult male from first responders.”


AND HERE'S THE KICKER,

"Multiple sources tell the Herald some of the adults were dressed as women when first responders arrived at the scene."I re-read your comment. I thought you were saying OP added “Transgender.” Reading is important.Distinguishing between two separate things is not splitting hairs.Splitting hairs?  This is being used as political propaganda.  People in drag is VERY different than transgender, that is not splitting hairs.  It is a nonsense title.Wig / hairs / transgender/ split🤓No, you’re ignoring things you don’t like and playing make believe .Plenty of people dress in drag and have no intention of ever transitioning or even view themselves as misgendered. It’s just fun for them. Do you not see the difference? 

If I smoke weed does that make me a crackhead? No, that’s dumb.We know the race of the person who died . Do your research. 

The council members were silent on this abomination .  Same for local media and other elected officials who are virtue signaling how righteous they are for other matters.  Race/gender are touchy subjects in liberal states.  

I made no such suggestion.  So typical.  

There is no bigotry going on here.  Calm your liver, muffin.  What happened is seriously troubling to our community.  You don’t live here, so you know not of what you speak.The absolute non-coverage of the twitter files on reddit tells you everything you need to know about reddit.It doesn’t bother you that the article is just making up details about the story?Well apparently your radar is broken, cause that title right there is propaganda.I’m in my 30s and still feel trauma for my brother and his friends doing drugs in front of me. 

The fact people don’t see this as abuse is wild to meWhy did the firefighters fill out the forms then to let CPS (or whatever they are called in Massachusetts) that the kids were being abused or in an abusive situation?That’s not my point. My point is don’t demonize them as transgender. They’re just shitty people.You've never smoked crack and worn wigs?  Nothing scummy about that.  Super fun to walk around high in a wig.Its neither of those things. Obviously people should keep the nudity and sex stuff at home or in adult venues. I stand by my statement though. People should act morally right, but they shouldn't be ostracized for there oddities unless they are causing harm on others. (Physical, sexual, mental, etc.) So if some man for example wants to where a skirt let him, it's very comfortable and breezy. If he has his balls hanging out at the playground (or in public) though then yeah of course that's wrong.There are people who cross dress. Come on. You can’t be this dumb guys.Lol no it doesn’t. Everything about these people’s actions are abusive. The act of wearing a wig isn’t abuseSame difference to someone ignorant & uneducated, sure.Where does it say transgender???

You do know cross dressing and being transgender are WILDLY different things, right?Caught the first one, but missed the second. We're living in a simulation programmed by a degenerate 12 year old, it's just too on the nose.Well a split is necessary for gender trans of a male.The race of the dead man isn’t identified in the article. Race of the men doesn’t matter to anyone except you, the OP and the other bigots and racists interested in adding race to this LGBTQ related incident. Focus on the facts that matter if you don’t want to be labeled a bigot/racist.It was an easy fight, not many people fought back. My mom got fired from her high paying job bc she wouldn’t conform.Sadly, true. Same with the mainstream media.now how exactly is the LGBTQ+ community a cult??? please explain because that makes absolutely 0 sense. get out of here with your queerphobia.>they been teaching Columbus discovered America for the longest and he never stepped foot in America, he made it to like the Bahamas or something

It's not a false statement. "America" includes North, Central, and South America, including the Bahamas.This isn’t being covered anywhere else that I’m seeing. And that’s not even the point of my post. It’s about censorship>the article is just making up details about the story

What's your evidence for this claim?Totally.
They were even attempting to hide the kids….
No RED FLAGS there….!That’s what I thought. It honestly felt weird and confrontational that you were asking me my point when I thought I was just agreeing with you.Well, until a large group of "Trans" come out against the grooming and violation of innocent children, I'm lumping them all in together. Sorry, but this is definitely a case of guilt by association. Anyone willing to put up with pedophiles amongst their ranks are twistedSo they have to define themselves first…?
What if they say, “I don’t identify as a shitty person….?” Your argument /point is invalid.
Letting someone define themselves SO AS EVERYONE HAS TO MAINTAIN THEIR FALSE SENSE OF IDENTITY is asking for confusion … ps. I identify as knowing everything…
Please recognize my identity and don’t argue with me..I'll take your word for it. My crack smoking days are overI totally agree with your statement.

Just like I wouldn't want a heterosexual couple whipping each other in a child friendly space, nor do I want a trans couple doing it.First step to become trans is to put on another gender's clothes. People don't just wake up one day and cut their penises off. It's a slower progression. 

You're acting so enlightened and empathetic, but it would be more empathetic to get these kids into therapy instead of encouraging the desecration of their bodies, a permanent consequence to something that is likely temporary and related to hormones.You just wrote above in your own comment that it was more than a wig. You also failed to mention the multitude of sex toys accessible to children.You’re the first one who brought up race.  🎤A normal adult is born as a homosexual, a heterosexual or a bisexual. 

People *decide* to become trans or one of the other alphabet parts.

That means you've got to truly believe that you are a woman, even if you have a penis. And all of the people around you have also got to believe that too and validate you. 

It's that word, "belief", that means it is a cult. Just like you have to believe in God without any proof if you're a Christian.

I dgaf if someone wants to be a Christian or whatever. As long as I'm allowed to answer honestly if I also "believe" in it.

But this gets in the way of validation. Hence the bullying and calling of amde up  names like "queerphobic".Yea but he isn't significant to our countries founding in anyway. Leif Erikson made here way before Columbus and actually stepped foot on this continent, not to mention the millions of natives that had already found this place. Also the Chinese have a record of coming here too looong ago, same with the Vatican, there's actually a book about the church members and there trip here. Columbus is just some insignificant cookie cutter story to glorify an awful guy they keep regurgitating. Why even have a grand discovery story and just tell the truth lol. I'd probably let my kids go to a public high school if they wanted but I couldn't let the earliest years of my kids life go to being indoctrinated by the state. I'd at least like a chance to put them on the right path before I give them to the wolves“This isn’t being covered anywhere else” because the article you linked made it up.My evidence is that the “article” described the suspects as transgender in the headline, then copied and pasted the Herald’s article which makes no such claim.I must have projected your tone based on all the other dummies replying to me. Apologies.But they aren’t? That’s your paranoia dude.Yea. They have to identify themselves first. Pretty simple really.Cool 🙂 Have a nice day you sane individual!You’re just making stuff up now. 

You don’t know what you’re talking about and most people are not cutting their dicks off. 

What everyone here should be concerned about is these kids and the fact that they are now safe from abuse. What the men were or were not wearing is totally irrelevant.You’re not following the thread I see.You aren’t as clever as you think. 😂Well said. I was a huge Bernie supporter, if u told me what the dems would be pushing 4 yeArs later I wouldn’t believe it.did you know that, as children can identify as straight, they can also identify as being apart of the LGBTQ+ community. people are born how they are born, LGBTQ is not a choice. so there goes your first point. there should be pride for children because some children identify as part of the community. if you didn’t make the rest of your points SO FUCKING BIG maybe i’d actually bother to read the rest but your first point is all i need to know that you’re just queer phobic and have no logical argument as to why “LGBTQ+ is a cult”. also why are straight relationships allowed in kid’s television if gay relationships are “brainwashing” them ???????becoming transgender is NOT a choice. why would someone choose to make their life harder on purpose? you know trans people get killed, harassed, discriminated against, etc. and you think someone would choose that? and again, i’m not understanding how it’s a cult.. so someone is transgender and they’re accepted for who they are as a person so it makes it a cult?! why do you think people choose to be trans but then people are born as either gay, straight, or somewhere in between??? why do you think the rules are different if someone is gay and not trans. make it make sense. also queer phobic is not a made up word. getting downvoted yet no one is actually giving me a sensical argument. just say ur a transphobe and get on with it then.I disagree. Discovering something doesn't necessarily mean just "first," it means something more like "the first *with consequences*." Erikson and the Chinese don't really count because nothing consequential followed from their "discovery," while Columbus's discovery changed history.Well you can go look it up on other news sites. There are multiple sources reporting it at this point.https://www.bostonherald.com/2023/06/19/four-kids-found-hidden-in-filthy-south-boston-apartment-where-a-man-died/No worries, I completely understand. I can’t really blame you for that at all, I can guarantee I’m guilty of the same thing. Thanks for saying that though and clearing up our misunderstanding, I truly appreciate it. I apologize if I came off passive aggressive or rude in any way at any point. Stay safe out there.Can't gaslight me on this one, dude. I know what I've seen with my own eyes, with my own child in the public school system. Fafo. Leave people's kids alone. Period. End of story. I don't know why it's so fucking hard for you creeps to understandSo they can't report a "male suspect" at large, for example, unless they manage to find out what the suspect considers his gender to be first?

Do you realise how silly you are being yet? 

Your first instinct, when five children are murdered, is to jump in and say "but they weren't trans!". If that is your first instinct then your priorities need to be checked.

Tbh, so much you type makes you out to be a promoter of the sexualisation of children and a defender of perversion.It is relevant. Their mental health is tied to them wearing women's clothes and also to the fact they would hurt children. Look at the rates of domestic violence in the trans community, then look at the gay community and finally the straight community. It's different levels of mental health being played out in sexuality. The more hedonistic the person, the more along the spectrum they go. People like you are why no one talks about this stuff. Quit white knighting and acknowledge there is a giant correlation.Any mental health crises is concern for child abuse. Cross dressing is a vibrant flag of these concerns. A literal manifestation of their fragile mental health. Children should be taken from that abuse and parents/caregivers evaluated prior to children being allowed to be alone around them.So i actually didn't mean to make it big. And that sounds like something you would do lol not read it idc. And no they can't. Someone at work told me there 3 year old niece identifies as non binary... No she doesn't. Her parents taught her that shit. No way a 3 year old understands gender to that depth, I have children in the family that I baby sit almost everyday so I'm pretty familiar with the mind of a child. They might be smart but they can't make up there mind what they want to eat, let alone what gender they are. And if you think drugging children because they think they are a diff gender to start the process early or you support people who condone this activity you are a sicko and honestly I don't wanna argue with you. It's obvious in 10 years people are gonna realize how bad they fucked up and there's gonna be a lot of law suits and court cases because this shit is pure madness.We aren't talking about gay people. That's not a choice. It's a choice to take pharmaceuticals and chop your penis off. Anorexic patients identify as fat, are we supposed to valid them and watch them starve? I would assume that's unethical. If a child thought they were another gender would you validate them and give them drugs to start the process? I think everyone who doesn't live in clown world would see that that is highly unethical. Y'all have the right to do all the gay stuff y'all want and be as weird as you want because this is a free country, but for fucks sake leave the kids out of it. What is wrong with you peopleIt's that need to be "special" and also to become a protected breed. 

"o look at me, I'm special now because I'm using one of these new gender labels.Nobody can say anything against me, because that makes them a phobe".

And being a victim is super fashionable these days. Being stoic is not.

The shit that gay people had to go through to get the same rights as straight people is unimaginable. They had to win the argument against people who thought gay people were lesser people. They didn't do that with aggression, childhood indoctrination, and name calling. 

They just won the argument. They convinced people to reassess their own beliefs.

Yet now we've got the activist trans people sucking dildos in front of kids faces and calling people "transphobes" when they don't accept that behaviour.

The whole trans movement has received serious pushback in my country due to constant pushing and grooming. And has obviously damaged genuinely gender dysphoric people.Where in that article does it say they’re transgender?Show me the pedophiles “in their ranks”Show me these rates you speak of. I’ll wait.Oh so it wasn’t the drugs and squalor that we read kids being found in everyday by mostly straight parents? Gotcha.What if some male just finds skirts and dresses comfortable and has the balls to wear them without concern of the judgement of others? Is that a sign of poor mental health or is it a sign that the individual has the mental strength not to let societies norms stop him from doing what he finds comfortable? At face value my example sounds like a sign of mental strength to me. Maybe take it as food for thought. Intent means a lot and perhaps their are instances where one might wear something that isn't "traditionally male garb" without it suddenly meaning one is mentally unwell.so how can you say a child knows they are the gender they assigned at birth but if they say they are another gender then they’re not right ??? it makes absolutely no sense. if a child can decide they are the gender they were born as at birth, they can decide that they identify with a different gender. all of this is just a cute little way for you to say you’re a transphobic pos. trans is not a new thing, it’s just accepted now. i don’t wanna argue with you either, i hope u never have children yourself, no child deserves to feel unacceptable by their parent.so gay isn’t a choice but trans is??? more like none of it is a choice. if gender reassignment surgery helps someone else, so be it, it doesn’t effect you at all. no one is chopping your penis off against your will. what if i play devil’s advocate here & say you straights are shoving your bullshit down kid’s throats??? straight couples suck each other’s faces off in public all the time (where kids are! but as soon as a gay or anyone apart of LGBTQ+ does it it’s suddenly “shoving it down kids throats” yea right..who is sucking a dildo in front of a child’s face??? no one.oh i’m sorry that gay people have fought for the right to be treated like actual human beings (which they are). it seems like you’re just mad that people are getting positive attention for coming out and celebrating who they are. no one is magically gay all the sudden after it was somewhat normalized, they’re just more open now that it’s not ILLEGAL ffs. and yes, gay people are victims, because they get discriminated on on the daily and fucking illegal since basically forever.It doesn’t, but I am betting that’s what OP is referring to. Just noting context.Nowhere. There are news articles mentioning the men had wigs which implies drag, but that is not the same as transgender.Dudes in wigs and womens clothes bro. Meth, coke and dildos littered everywhere.  next door neighbor is a Boston FD guy, told me the scene was abhorrent.I direct you to the article at the center of our discussion.Very first one I found on Google!
 https://ncadv.org/blog/posts/domestic-violence-and-the-lgbtq-community

I'm not your assistant, you can handle the rest yourself.Lol people haven't been taking drugs and chopping off there organs to become a new gender until here recently I don't care what you say. And they sure as hell didnt bring kids into it.Because they see they have the same parts as mommy when they are a girl, and mommy takes them to the girls bathroom and vice versa for boys it becomes obvious. The duality of gender is the natural design of existence lol. Yin and yang. This is balance. It is the way life comes to be. Creating a hundred diff genders isnt balance. It's chaos and sounds like a lot of people need to go get a job and spend less time thinking about nonsenseAt least my kids won't have to rely on pharmaceuticals to continue keeping there body the opposite sex. They won't have a life time of debt and Dr bills and not to mention all the health problems that come with it. I hope you never have kids and convince them this is okIt doesn’t even necessarily imply drag.You’re just not smart or nuanced enough to have this conversation.So you understand the difference between domestic violence and violence against children? Did you even read it? I have.NO ONE IS DOING THAT. literally no one. gender reassignment surgery is only done after the age of 18 and after a considerable amount of therapy and professional intervention and a proper diagnosis of gender dysphoria. educate yourself instead of reading everything you believe online.so wouldn’t u call that brainwashing ??? see i could use all your arguments against you as well.if your kid comes out as trans, no matter what you think about it, they will get the proper treatment when they turn to an adult and probably never speak to you again. i’m not planning on having children, but if i did have one, i’d teach them that i’d love and accept them no matter what and it’s a shame you wouldn’t do the same. this kind of hate has no place in this world.okay first of all, like i said before, you cannot get gender reassignment surgery until you have turned 18 and it takes a LOT of work to even get that in the first place because they don’t just diagnose anyone who says they wanna be a different gender with gender dysmorphia, it’s years long process. and guess what? if the person decides that they do want to reverse the surgery, it can be done. as for hormones, they can stop those at any time as well and don’t have to be taken for the rest of the person’s life as you think. you should really educate yourself on this kind of thing before spouting nonsense on the internet.like i literally asked how being apart of the LGBTQ+ community was identical to being in a cult and you’ve given me nothing but untruthful, transphobic bullshit. none of what you’re saying is even true.Oh yeah, the people who can't decide if they're men or women are clearly the mentally superior breed. 🤣🤣🤣 fucking looneyYou'll just keep moving the goalposts. Here's another one, third link on Google when you search domestic violence rates bad on sexuality. Trans rates are even higher. Sorry you suck as a human being.

https://bjs.ojp.gov/library/publications/violent-victimization-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-2017-2020Cross dressers do it for entertainment or a kink. Transgender folks are in the world body. Both seem pretty clear to me.Again. Intimate partner violence is NOT violence against children. You’re the one moving thee goalpost buddy.bruh what. it literally has no permanent effect, you can stop taking them and your body will naturally start producing the hormones it was producing pre-transition. look it up it’s not rocket science. and it’s not big pharma either, we literally have hormones in our body naturally, all the hormone therapy is, is synthesized hormones that make people feel more comfortable in their body and i have nO idea why you care so much. no one is forcing you to take them, no one is forcing you to transition. and also the chance of someone wanting to de transition is very, very low. why are you so bothered by queer people??? what have we done to you???and i do believe gender transition treatment is free if cost if diagnosed with gender dysmorphia, or at least it is where i live. so there’s also that.and i don’t think it did take an hour to begin life changing treatment, you need YEARS of therapy before beginning it. look it ip. the parents were likely told this because they said some transphobic bullshit.you’re still going on about this? i refuse to argue with a bigot. leave me alone let me support human rights in peace dawg. gbye.No, they’re in the wrong state of mind. Ie confusion. Delusion. Zero acceptance in the simplest of identities is a red flag for other, and most likely more severe, mental instabilities.
More so when the trans agenda is being pushed by the media. Ie store bought reality, nothing organic, natural or real.No, is there any evidence that violence against adults negates violence against children? 

Violence begets violence, mental health is affected when someone is hit in one of those relationships. Abusers are known to traditionally also be victims of abuse. 

"Hurt people hurt people."I'm not bothered by gay people. I'm bothered by people who want to sexualize kids and condone them making fucked up choices. It's child abuse I don't care what you say. My nephew plays with dolls and thats ok. He knows he is a boy. He cries when I won't let him have candy. If he told me he was a girl I'm supposed to reinforce that and give him drugs? He one time said he wanted to be a girl because his sister gets everything. I asked him if that was the only reason and he said yes he basically just wants the same attention. Imagine if one of you sickos heard that and started giving him drugs and convincing him he was a girl? That's abuse idc what you say.So your telling me that years of hormone therapy can just be reversed on a totally underdeveloped body? I think that's bullshit. You can't just suppress what the body does naturally for years and expect it to magically go away when you stop taking the drugs. If that was the truth why do drug addicts have life long problems after being sober for years? Because they have been suppressing what their body naturally does for years. It something difficult to recover from I promise you. And that goes for Dr prescribed drugs too not just the illegal ones. You can't just drug your body for years and one day stop and think everything is ok and back to normal. The same people telling you that are the same people that make pharmaceutical commercials probably haha and we all know how those end ...Poor Chloe even said like I said it. "She made an adult decision as a kid and regrets it" that's why you don't do this to kids.https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12207743/amp/Detransitioning-woman-18-suing-Kaiser-Permanente-pushing-gender-changing-surgery.html here ya goAnd here is another link   https://www.google.com/amp/s/freebeacon.com/latest-news/child-butchers-detransitioner-files-first-us-lawsuit-against-hospital-that-performed-sex-change/amp/So go ahead and keep using my arguments against me. Looks like you are doing a great job so far...Do you want more links to story's of physically and chemically butchered children?It’s not pushed by the media, it’s educating society. But some refuse to see that.> No, they’re in the wrong state of mind. 

Is being gay a "wrong state of mind" as well?That’s exactly what your mom told me about you.you are the ONLY person who has been bringing up children here buddy. sick fuck.Why do we care so much about trans people?I got into Jordan Peterson by reading his 12 rules for life and there is absolutely nothing in that great book to go after trans people

Now. Here is the truly honest take: I don't know any trans person. I don't care about them. I have to go out of my way to meet them. On my daily life it really isn't an issue for me to accept that there is people who choose to live life in a different way than me

I came to this sub looking for tips for help self improvement and maybe some new rules for life but this place is all about pride and trans and so many thing outside my world that I really don't care aboutMany people were first introduced to Jordan because of his public opposition to Bill C-16, which introduced gender identity to the protected classes under law. He saw this as compelled speech, which was his primary reason to be against it, not necessarily anything against trans people.

But, he has also talked about trans issues a lot.

So it's really no surprise that people would talk about it here.

This isn't "r/twelverulesforlife". It's about everything JBP. And he has talked about a lot. You could reasonably have conversations about Jung and metaphors in disney cartoons, without even reaching to his more obscure topics.

But if you wanted to tie this to his rules, how about rules 5, 7 8 and 10? Do not let your children do anything that makes you dislike them. Pursue what is meaningful, not what is expedient. Tell the truth, or at least don't lie. Be precise in your speech.

A lot of conservatives have concerns about the trans issues because it represents one of the most popular "attacks" on traditional values.

It's also just a popular topic of debate more broadly speaking. Almost everyone has heard about it, even if they don't have any strong opinions about it.Honestly, no one really did care (generally speaking) until it became trendy, started negatively affecting kids, and until very obvious biological men started invading women-only spaces.JP is dissed by the alphabet people because they endeavor to co-opt govt authority to compel speech that “affirms” them and criminalizes speech that “denies” them. 

JP is against compelled speech. And the alphabet people hate him for it.In as few words as possible:
People romanticized mental illness
It became trendy. 
Extremists took over the movement.
Now predators are abusing the new standard.If you cannot accept what is and are coerced into accepting some delusional paradigm, how can you even have the foundations necessary for meaning?

It's like trying to play Super Mario World while pretending it's Sonic. You won't get far and it's offensive to creation.We don't.

Trans activists on the other hand...There are doctors that are removing healthy organs from children and adults in the name of mental heath! Why don't you care about that? We are going to have tens of thousands of very confused and regretful people if this stuff keeps happening.I don’t care about trans people or what anyone chooses to do with their life. But when you open ANY app during June only to see a rainbow on the logo…. Planet Fitness just opened in our tiny 10,000 people town in the conservative south of the US and first thing you see when you go in is a giant “Flex your PRIDE” screen and “pride merch” sales… is too much “in your face” to me… can’t imagine what it’s like in big cities…If you read about Soviet Russia or the roots of Nazi germany, you would care. Because then you’d understand how dangerous ideas progress from minorities to domination.Make mental institutions great againI agree that its often too much, that's for sure.

That doesn't mean it's important.   I think that this is a movement trying to demand that 2+2=5.

Soltsynitzn wrote in his book that authoritarianism begins with people accepting the lies from the government.   

This feels like that initial lie.  That's probably what gets people fired up so much.Because a bunch of rich people are paying politicians and businesses trillions of dollars to push it onto society as normal.My theory is that it's easier to talk about the trans than talk about the line of good and evil that crosses everyone's heart.we only care a lot about protecting our kids at school… maybe a little bit about women getting hosed in sports. Outside of that, trans away!Sometimes the trans lobby spin it around and say “so what are you all getting worked up over it’s only less than 1 % of population” - ya so…so what ?  I think rational people understand as soon as you don’t set down boundaries it spreads when given free reign. A certain age group in USA went from 0.6% trans and non binary to a whole 5% in less than 10 years.We don't yet they keep inserting their agenda into daily life and eventsHere’s my take.

Jordan Peterson grew in popularity because of opposition to forced speech and the use of pronouns. But as of late, he’s used his platform to promote hate instead of love. As this has increased, this sub has gone from a place of reasonable debate, to transphobic, drag phobic and gayphobic users.

The amount of comments I see asking or condoning death to queer folk is honestly sad. Extremist have taken over this sub, as evidenced by any comments section. They are hateful, will upvote any comment that promotes hate , and downvote any comment for reasoned debate.

Welcome to the internet.You are looking for r/confrontingchaos this sub is just political/philosophical meme responding and generating echo chamber.

Some people love it. Some people think JP is actually on here and write him messages. Some people are here to be trolls and brigade. Others think they are meaningfully "fighting the good fight", and not just regurgitating the same content as last week.

Some of us miss the before times when this place was a bastion of intellectual dark web sophistication and dialogue, but stick around anyways out of pure nihilism.Because it's a distraction and it gets views. Trans people are less than 1% of the population so it's low hanging fruit to demonize them with no real consequences plus it allows people like Jordan Peterson to say controversial things that will get him more attention. Basically it's identity politics being used for marketing but it's not really a logical thing to be obsessed over when you look at things going on in the world. Right now there's like 2 or 3 wars, nobody can afford a house, there's an opioid epidemic, the US is on the brink of civil war with a failing infrastructure, climate disasters occur regularly, people can't afford groceries, young men are essentially giving up on life and killing themselves, blackrock owns everything and all this subreddit can think about is the genitalia of 1% of the population. The US has the most incarcerated juveniles out of every developed country in the world but you don't see that being brought up when this rhetoric is about "protecting children". Food banks are running low, there's increasing numbers of houseless families etc etc. Maybe I just don't understand the "higher thinking" happening amongst y'all or maybe your idol has sold out and likes the attention/$$$ he gets from screeching about this subjectForced pronoun use, transitioning in kids, men in women's sports. Those are the main ones. Then the obvious romanticization of mental illness, which again affects kids and teenagers who are naturally dumb. 

Below those ones, the fact that men in dresses are portrayed as something very beautiful and feminine is pretty annoying, but if it were just this, it would be fine. It would be just a thing to home about12 Rules for Life

Why would it mention anything about trans people? It's 12 rules for life. It's a self help book.Because trans ideology is the most obvious sign that society is losing it's damn mind.

Almost a third of the country doesn't know what a woman is and can't tell you the difference between a woman and a man. Every single Democrat in the House of Representatives voted to allow men to compete in women's sports. People outside of the US are being found guilty of a crime for disbelieving that men can transform into women. It's considered "progressive" to tell middle school girls in gym class that they have to change clothes in front of the opposite sex.

Is it the biggest problem in the world, of course not. But it's insane that such a stupid and illogical ideology has managed to convince the media and the President and major corporations that women don't deserve equal rights and people should be punished for refusing to agree with lies.I’ve only met one person who used “they/them” pronouns and she was from up North (just a tomboy.)

I think what attracted so many normal people to Peterson was his stance against compelled/forces speech by the Government. 

The trans issue has now evolved into children’s rights and if the government is able to change your child’s sex without any parental say (happening right now in California.)We don't. We care about censorship laws, and sexualized child indoctrination in schools.It depends where you live quite frankly. I live in a progressive area of Cali and I interact with quite a few due to this. I care because a little school in my area was trying to radicalized the students to be part of the alphabet group, particularly to be Trans while keeping it from the parents. It is an evil movement that seeks to destroy and corrupt our children.I care because I care about truth. This shit matters, and I’m not going to just let hive mind or bullies gaslight us into submission on an issue that they are so obviously wrong about.

Call me pedantic, but I’m not going to abide that.Having to abandon gender determinism and accommodate/consider different identities offends and upsets many people, Peterson among them

He explains why right here: https://twitter.com/benryanwriter/status/1627873706209865728

“What the hell should I do with you?” Oh, I dunno; treat me like a person instead of a stereotype? NahWe're sick of your obvious lie.Because JBP is the number one ideological figurehead of transphobia in America. If anyone can be said to have almost singlehandedly poisoned this well, it's him. His lemmings followed him into the darkBecause we live rent free in your heads, pretty flattering actuallybecause picking yourself up in the midst of despair/agony and becoming a man people can look up to and rely on includes going on reddit and complaining about meaningless shit. duh.Note the way its all directed at trans women. 

Its a phobia about trans women in particular.

Here is one trans woman's take .

https://www.reddit.com/r/facepalm/comments/14lej2n/they_are_really_scared/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_buttonno one here nor does JP cares about whether someone is or is not transgender. I think it's safe to say that if some chooses to live their life as the opposite sex, everyone here and JP would not take issue with it, or think ill of them. The aspect of the trans activist movement that myself, others on this sub, and JP do take issue with is the insistence that everyone adhere to the fallacious statement that there is no sex or gender other than what you make. That identifying as as given gender makes you indistinguishable in every way from someone born that gender. That "trans women are women" -- no, they are not. And the compelled speech, cultist zeolotry, and compulsory newthink around the topic is nothing short of egregious bullshitDon't come on here. Just keep listening to JBP. There's so much of him to listen to. Maps of personality lectures. Biblical lectures. Great interviews. You can even re-listen to Jordan Peterson. Listen to whatever helps you best180ism. Both sides feeding off each other especially by media.It's a tempest in a teapot for sure. No one is actually being forced to use the pc pronouns, despite all the antis who have always screamed false flags about their govt restricting freedoms which their govt actually didnt. Either the govt is forcing vaccination, forcing them to drive an EV, taking their guns away, etc. Man, how can anyone think woke is silly, while being so paranoid and creating such drama over minutia?It’s like when you try to run a science page, and always someone brings it down to creationism, so you spend every discussion trying to talk about interesting things, but end up having to deal with the Goddidit crowd.They don't....they just won't lets us not careI didn't care until they started forcing things on us. Compelled speech is not OK in any circumstance.If they can make you believe a man is woman, they can make you believe group X is evil and needs to be exterminated.I agree with you on some of this. I actually do have trans friends. I'm accepting of them as they are. I use there pronouns etc. I would probably even vote to continue allowing them to be trans.

I have a friend who works in fast food. He has seen people get fired for using the wrong pronouns. And he has also seen upper management hide rape/sexual assault and those people still work there. 

I don't think getting this mad about pronouns should be happening. Its kind to use someone pronouns. If you don't, you might be an asshole. But it shouldn't be illegal.

Not sure if that sort of answers some of your question.Because the left has turned into woke nazis.Nobody cared until they started to force words into your mouth and especially when children got involved

My line is crossed when it comes to children. And many ppl think the same#Lots of incels and closet queers here. Talking shit about women and homos make them feel better about being lamesPeople in general don't care. BUT, it became a wedge issue in recent times, so now it's where the battle is occurring. It's the beach head in the war for objective reality. If the "a trans woman IS a woman" wins, then a lot of shit will change both legally and socially. Women's sports will end, having a clear behavioural distinction between men and women as demographics will collapse which has far reaching implications in marketing, policing, prisons, medicine, behavioural predictions, biological assessments and categorizing, everything. Children will suffer because their best interests in care will no longer take into account the behavioural differences between mothers and fathers, men and women. All new immigrants will be absolutely confused for the lack of distinction between men and women as well the confusion around the butchering of the english language as well. The slippery slope of post modernism won' stop and blowing apart the distinction between men and women, it will continue and affect every distinction you can think of, including being a citizen of a country, your age, your species, art, math, science, every single possible discipline that seeks to understand the world in a set of categories will collapse. You have evidence of this already occurring in the way terms like "minor attracted" or "undocumented immigrant" or people identifying as animals, all of modern art, book companies changing classic works of art, criterion collections editing movies, the term TERF, the idea that an entire company comprised of black people can be called white supremacist because of a metaphysical racism called systemic racism, university debate clubs allowing spoken word to suffice as proper argumentation, this shit is all around us, the barbarians are literally at the gates.Because they spread harmful bullshit.

Gender being a "spectrum" denies the neurological aspects of gender and gender dysphoria.

They lie about puberty blockers being "100% reversible with zero side effects"

They brush under the rug Norway, Finland, UK, Sweden, Netherlands are slowing down treatment for minors and revaluating them. 

They die on the dumbest hills regarding minors and sports participation. 

They deem detrans people and any criticism of healthcare as "hate"We don't. They are just a daily annoyance. Insisting that you use their self chosen pronouns, demanding access to women's private spaces, abolishing womens sports records, grooming of children and frankly the horrible fashion choices are all being forced on society.Exactly, people often forget that the trans issue is what made him famous to begin with. Jordan is very pro-free speech.>Many people were first introduced to Jordan because of his public opposition to Bill C-16

I was one of them!

>This isn't "r/twelverulesforlife". It's about everything JBP. And he has talked about a lot. You could reasonably have conversations about Jung and metaphors in disney cartoons, without even reaching to his more obscure topics.

And thats a really fair answer to my post. People change and evolve, but I think that Mr. Peterson still think himself as a self helping guide... maybe I'm wrong

But also, I think that his recent stuff has been going against the 12 rules. I don't think it's unfair for me to ask this question in this sub, seeing as the 12 rules is his most popular book/work>But if you wanted to tie this to his rules, how about rules 5, 7 8 and 10? Do not let your children do anything that makes you dislike them. Pursue what is meaningful, not what is expedient. Tell the truth, or at least don't lie. Be precise in your speech.

Rule 5 contradicts rule 7, you would want to pursue a meaningful relationship with your child instead of alienating them by forcing your views on them.

Being trans is not expedient and being trans is what's best for trans people, who know the truth about themselves better than anyone.That isn't even what got JBP interested in the trans issues. What initially got him involved in the trans debate was the fact that the government wanted to force pronoun use, which is against free speech. JBP is a scientist, and science depends on free speech. Without free speech, science is dead.>According to statistics from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) about **229,000 cosmetic procedures** were performed on patients aged 13 to 19 in 2017, though research by board-certified plastic surgeons Rod J. Rohrich, M.D. and Min-Jeong Cho, M.D. of the Dallas Plastic Surgery Institute found that very few guidelines are in place to ensure teen plastic surgeries are performed appropriately.

>Currently, teenagers account for about four percent of all cosmetic surgery procedures, with the most common procedures among teens being nose reshaping, male breast reduction and ear surgery.

Where as there were only **282 children getting trans surgery in 2021.** It's just not enough to effect Western Civilization.This take is at least a few years old at this point. With jp we’re far past the “compelled speech” argument, he’s obviously gone more radical there is no denying that. You can agree or disagree with him, but his rhetoric isn’t about compelled speech anymore, it’s all about “butchers” and extreme conservatism, which is a shame IMO, these aren’t jps strong sides. I wish he stopped doing all these stupid hostile interviews and stopped using Twitter altogether. He inspired a lot of people especially lost men, that is good, he’s drifted since though, once again, I personally think he drifted in the wrong direction. 12 rules and beyond order are still quite good introductory poppsych books.The "alphabet people" just want protection against harassment based on gender, not compelled speech. Anyone can misuse the power and that should be judged on an individual level.

You think verbal harassment shouldn't be penalized because someone might misuse them?Not really, only the loud obnoxious alphabet people is against free speech. Most of them understand that free speech is necessary, perhaps even more so for them as the right to free speech is how they have managed to shift the political climate and earn rights.Mental illness is trendy, you are right about that. It isn't even just trans anymore but bipolar disorder and Tourette's are trendy on TikTok.Calling minority mentally ill : Check

Calling the movement for equality an extremist movement : Check

Calling the minority as predators : Check.>If you cannot accept what is

I think this is the root of the motive I had while making this post. I'm having trouble understanding "what is".

All I know is my personal experience, but I know that is only limited to me.

If I'm honest, I don't really understand how someone can "feel like a man" or "feel like a woman", but that goes for any position. What does it mean to "be a man" or "to be a woman"?

Here is what I know about Jordan Peterson: He made a really good book about being responsible for one self well being. I'm having trouble accepting some of the new things he has been talking aboutIf you cannot accept that trans people exist then you’re the one who is delusionalI don't see a post every day about JP on any of the trans subs.Its not healthy if it's causing mental illness. Regret rated are almost zero, and tend to be due to a lack of supoort/acceptance from their social circles.> There are doctors that are removing healthy organs from children and adults in the name of mental heath!

If it causes mental health issues, it is clearly not healthy.

>We are going to have tens of thousands of very confused and regretful people if this stuff keeps happening.

This is what they've been saying for years, the numbers are yet to actually change in proportion.I dont think its that different than any other event though. Christmas, New Years, Halloween.Yeah because trans people = Nazis.Exactly! We need to leery of groups pursing the similar tactics and ideologies of the Nazis and Soviets.

Like an organized campaign to ban books that disagree with a parties ideology.

Or attacking and othering sexual minorities.

# The burnings start

>On 6 May 1933, the Berlin chapter of the German Student Union made an organised attack on Magnus Hirschfeld's Institut für Sexualwissenschaft (roughly: Institute of Sex Research). It's assumed that Dora Richter, the first transgender woman known to have undergone sex reassignment surgery (by doctors at the institute), may have been killed during the attack.

Literally the first Nazi book burning was not targeted at Jews, but at the LGBTQ community.

&#x200B;

The Nazi's Persecuted, Jailed, and Kill Homosexuals just like they did the Jews

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution\_of\_homosexuals\_in\_Nazi\_Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_homosexuals_in_Nazi_Germany)Do you have a scientific source that says that trans people are not what they say they are or gender is the same as sex?If it's about protecting kids then why are states banning gender affirming healthcare for adults?How are kids being affected at school by trans people at all?Trends don’t last forever. It’ll shoot back down to 0.6% in a few yearstrans women in sports is such a non issue. it’s ridiculous how caught up in it all y’all are> if the government is able to change your child’s sex without any parental say (happening right now in California.)

No it isn't.You are the hivemind of bullies, dumbass. Look at conservatives across history. LGBTQ people have been oppressed by the forces you represent. The only one trying to flip the script and gaslight people are you intolerant pieces of shitYou did a fantastic job of completely misunderstanding his point.

When we start interacting with other people, we generally know their gender without having to ask or be told.  And we generally know how to interact with people of that gender in a broad, non-individualized sense.

Yes, this is based on stereotypes, but most stereotypes exist because there is at least *some* truth to them.  So, using those stereotypes as a cautionary guardrail in our interactions with that other person until we get to know that person as an individual.

Once we've done that, we can tailor our interactions with that person based on filters that are more specific to their identity as an individual.

And that system works pretty well when you only have two genders to interact with, because: 

1. The broad category of men *generally* have a set of standards by which we can interact with each other in a manner that is unlikely to cause significant conflict.
2. The broad category of women *generally* have a set of standards by which we can interact with each other in a manner that is unlikely to cause significant conflict.
3. The broad category of men *generally* have a set of standards by which they can interact with women in a manner that is unlikely to cause significant conflict.
4. The broad category of women generally have a set of standards by which they can interact with men in a manner that is unlikely to cause significant conflict.

Essentially, it's a very basic system, but it allows you to show the other party civility while you get to know them better.

Even with this very basic system, it is sometimes difficult enough for neurotypical people with normal social skills to avoid significant conflict.  It is a real struggle for people with subpar social skills, especially those who are neurodivergent, to engage in even those most basic of interactions, even with the simple binary template.

If you search the internet for "how many genders are there?" you'll get a bunch of articles that all look the same that give you some boilerplate about how sex and gender are different and give some examples of the different genders that supposedly exist.  You'll find a few pages that claim to list "all" of the genders.  And you'll maybe find one or two pages that actually claim a particular number of genders.

I found one page that says there are "72 other genders" in addition to "male" and "female" (never mind that those two words are generally used to refer to "sex" rather than "gender," and almost every discussion of the topic insists that sex and gender are not only "not the same," but that they aren't even really related to one another).  That's a total of 74 genders.

I found another page that says there are "81 Types Of Genders & Gender Identities."

Under this system, nobody knows how many genders there are.  Even those who do their absolute damnedest to be the best ally ever and to keep up with the ever-changing sea of gender identities and pronouns is going to go around proverbially stepping on rakes trying to interact with one of the 653 genders out there.

The average person absolutely does not and will not keep up with the ever-growing unkempt forest of which pronouns go with which gender identities.

And the more socially inept and/or neurodivergent among us just flat out *can't* keep up with that insanity unless it happens to also be that individual ND's special interest.

If 1% or fewer of all people are actually trans (which is the number I see bandied about the most), then that means that 99% of people *aren't* trans, which means that 99% of people *do* fit into that binary social template.

If, for whatever reason, you're going to get offended by the basic civility template that *should* work for 99% of the population, then the most civil thing a person can do is to not interact with you at all.XX and XY is pretty deterministic buddyI don't think the 12 rules for life targeted people wanting to "become a man". What do you mean?Like Ellen/Elliot Page?

Or the multiple hours of content discussing the "psychological contagion" affecting young female individuals?

It doesn't seem to me like the trans debates on this sub are "gendered" strongly in any particular direction.That was also on my mind. There is never a take from a trans man on the mainstream media. It's all about women or trans women

But why tho? The 12 rules I think applies to every human beingWomen have all reason to be scared of male violence.It's directed at the men pretending to be woman because they cause all of the harm.

They have an unfair advantage in sports. They stare at women in the women's locker rooms, or expose their dick and balls like Lia Thomas. They demand to be sent to a women's prison so they can rape women there.

The women pretending to be men don't have an unfair advantage, rarely ever even try to compete in men's sports, and don't sexually assault the men.

If we had an epidemic of adults pretending to be children so they can beat children in sports, guess what? We'd be more focused on the harm done by that, than on the children who pretend to be adults.

It's about the harm caused by trans ideology, and nearly all the harm is inflicted by men pretending to be women.> no one here nor does JP cares about whether someone is or is not transgender.

JP's twitter would disagree, i see a trans post almost every day on this sub.

>. I think it's safe to say that if some chooses to live their life as the opposite sex, everyone here and JP would not take issue with it, or think ill of them. 

JP literally called trans people as groomers including Elliot Page

> is the insistence that everyone adhere to the fallacious statement that there is no sex or gender other than what you make.

Not sex, gender, and it is not only trans activists, it is also every single major medical organization. 

You're against scientific consensus by insisting you know more about someone's gender identity than they do.

> That identifying as as given gender makes you indistinguishable in every way from someone born that gender.

Ideally all people should be treated the same regardless of gender, a woman should be treated the same as a man, why should be different if it was a trans person?

You would call a man by whatever name/pronouns he goes by, why would you not do the same for a trans person?

And trans people is not claiming that trans women are biologically the same as cis women, but trans women should be treated the same as cis women and come under the category of "women".

>That "trans women are women" -- no, they are not.

Yes they are, they may not be cis women, but they are women nonetheless.trans people just want to be left aloneThe other side must've found a way to skip that step, since you already hate trans people with a passion.How does questioning trans ideology go against his self-help philosophy? The science suggests transitioning increases depression and the risk of suicide, and if Jordan wants to give self-help advice, why wouldn't he speak out against transitioning? After all, one of the things self-help is for is to treat and prevent depression and prevent people from feeling useless.Right. Telling myself and society that, although my penis seems to suggest I am male, my brain is actually that of a woman. How meaningful. Definitely not just an expedient way to try to deal with my mental health issues.I think this 3 min clip explains it pretty well. A “medical historian” claims there is no such thing as biological sex and Jordan doesn’t even really get to rebut the claim because they redirect to pronoun usage (later on, the historian says Jordan is guilty of hate speech). I think Jordan is right to be disturbed by this and focus on it: https://youtu.be/WI8HrZ7mnl8>the fact that the government wanted to force pronoun use

That's not what C-16 did. This is reflected in the fact that no one has been arrested or imprisoned for refusing to use a person's preferred pronouns.

Jordan's reason for initial involvement in the trans "debate" is a lie.JBP is not a scientist, he's a Jungian. Go watch his interview with Dawkins to see Jordan's actual beliefs put on display.Surgery and/or other medical intervention is only a very small portion of how the trend is negatively affecting kids.The debate is about concepts.  Literal people are sometimes a segue but rarely the actual subject of the conversation.  

These debates are about ideas in which lots of people (mostly NOT trans) are emotionally invested.  

It's not about "money" BTW either.  I have similar criticism for those who come on here with conspiracy theories about the huge stacks of money that the trans "industry" pulls in.  I think that's bullshit too (enraging 99.95% of people to bilk 0.05% of people is a bad financial conspiracy)

....this is about the perceived security, psychological comfort, and relationship with the "truth" of mostly (because of demographics) regular gender/sex conforming people.It's easier to spread hate for "a bad idea" than actual human beings, so this sub works to spread hate for "trans ideology" which has the side effect of increasing hate for actual trans people.JP writes that if you have something to say, silence is a lie. 

You’d apparently prefer he be a liar.Refusing to call someone their "preferred" pronoun is absolutely not verbal harassment.Ignoring the science: check

Using hyperbole to manipulate what I said: check

Ignore what I actually said: check

Deny the fact predators are using the movement and being protected by those same protesters: checkI accept that people feel…wrong… about things in their lives. 

My simple question is; what event, study (empirical), etc occurred that changed the accepted treatment for a mental illness from therapies to surgeries?  

What event (might be the same one, or different) caused our society (i should say “some parts of our society) to accept the idealization of a mental illness?

And I’ll add that while there has been a huge push to make sure that gender dysphoria is no longer labeled as a mental illness, almost all descriptions about it say it entails emotional discomfort, anxiety, and unease… All of which are mental health issues.I accept they exist, I just think they are wrong on a fundamental level. Just like you may think someone solving problems with alcohol is wrong. Does that invalidate their existence or mean I don't care? Nope.Nobody's that's earnestly debating is debating "existence".I don't think this way of engaging is in any way productive.

Even if you are right, all that you are achieving is getting the other person absolutely defensive about their position.So if you are a doctor and a person comes in who says they feel like a one armed person trapped in the body of a two armed person. Do you amputate one of their arms for them?So to you is the same Christmas, which is celebrated by 90 out of 100 people; than Pride, which targets a tiny fringe of the population? Don’t you think the push is disproportional?That’s not at all what I said, Kathy Newman. Don’t put words in my mouth. Perhaps you should ask some questions to understand what I mean before putting words in my mouth.which states have banned hormone therapy and/or surgery?Trans ideology is being taught in some schools. They're telling children that it's possible for men to transform into women. They're teaching kids that not fitting into stereotypes and/or normal teenage awkwardness are signs that you need sex change surgery and pills. They're teaching kids that women are physically equal to men and that men vs women in sports is a fair competition.

And while this isn't necessarily "trans", NYC spent $200k in a year for drag queen performances at public schools.trans *people* - meh, no big deal. Trans *ideology* is the concern. Let’s say your daughter doesn’t like girly stuff. Maybe she simply needs to learn that being female doesn’t mean she has to act like a Kardashian. Instead, convince her that the solutions to normal adolescent emotional struggles are poorly understood, irreversible chemical and/or surgical interventions!Only a non issue if it doesn't affect you or anyone you know.

I don't want my daughter or anyone else's daughter to have to change in front of men, or compete against men. I don't want anyone's 10 year old son to have to compete against a grown adult who pretends to be a 10 year old. I'm against denying reality in order to let delusional people cheat in sports. A lot of people spend countless hours training to be competitive in sports and they shouldn't be cheated.

And it's concerning that corporations, the media, the President, and social media mods all support this lying and cheating, and the mods want to censor people who are against it.

Yes it's not the most important issue in the world, but not every discussion on Reddit is about the most important things in the world.Um…yes it is.

Unless the only reason I talk to a person is to try and fuck them. Hmmmmm, maybe that’s the root of the problemi discovered jordan peterson through many of his speeches as colleges. these speeches were particularly receptive to a demographic of males. i’ve been following peterson for awhile now and i can’t help but see that many of his teachings strike a chord with male listeners and kind of give them a voice/motivation they didn’t previously have. 

there’s also quite a few SIGMA MALE style edits dedicated to peterson as well.Thats mainly jp. Not the users here and rad cons in general. 

What is a woman isn't called what is a woman and what is a man.> But why tho?

Men pretending to be woman cause nearly all of the harm. Women pretending to be men do not.

The men have an unfair advantage in sports. They stare at women in the women's locker rooms, or expose their dick and balls like Lia Thomas. They demand to be sent to a women's prison so they can rape women there.

The women pretending to be men don't have an unfair advantage, rarely ever even try to compete in men's sports, and don't sexually assault the men.

If we had an epidemic of adults pretending to be children so they can beat children in sports, guess what? We'd be more focused on the harm done by that, than on the children who pretend to be adults.

It's about the harm caused by trans ideology, and nearly all the harm is inflicted by men pretending to be women.Homophobia, misogyny and maybe toxic elements of socialized masculinity could explain it. 

Its more ok for a woman to present as a man than it is the other way around.But can you show that you are a women's campaigner in other settings or is it just a cover for bashing trans women?

If there were neutral bathrooms, would you be OK with trans woman then or would there still be animosity?they were left alone this whole time.Suppressing speech, rounding up minoritiesI would go further. In beyond order in Beyond Order rule 1 is “do not carelessly denigrate social institutions”. This rule highlighted that whilst we might think of these structures in our society as arbitrary, old, or strange. It’s pretty clear that we wouldn’t be here without them. 

Applied to today, if we allow the complete destruction and mockery of gender (labelled a social construct/institution) in the obvious case it quite clearly leads (and is leading to) the sterilisation of children. In the less obvious, removes the fabric of the entire societies that have been built for us. On the chopping block is virtually everything that’s not a pure hedonistic joy.

Sure we can say; leave the trans people alone. As people, that’s fine. However as a professor and clinical psychologist seeing people’s mental issues being indulged and fed to the point people are paying horrendous amounts for surgery, sterilising themselves then later committing suicide rather than worked through - it must be absolute torture to witness.People have issue with his 12-year-old-boyish behavior he displays on twitter. It's hard to deny it's disgraceful.>The science suggests transitioning increases depression and the risk of suicide

Can you show me the science?>The science suggests transitioning increases depression and the risk of suicide

[That is incorrect](https://whatweknow.inequality.cornell.edu/topics/lgbt-equality/what-does-the-scholarly-research-say-about-the-well-being-of-transgender-people/)"The science suggests transitioning increases depression and the risk of suicide"

Do you mind if I ask you what studies are demonstrating this? I have tried to look into the studies presented by Ryan Anderson as he seems to be one of the more prominent writers on this subject, and the studies he cites mention that suicide risk is higher among the trans-gender community than it is in the general population, but I'm not seeing anything that says that suicidal tendencies increase after reassignment. They do suggest that transitioning does little to reduce the risk of suicide, but arguing that it increases the risk is very different. Even the example that he claims is "The most thorough follow-up of sex-reassigned people" concludes that there needs to be more done post-transition to "improved psychiatric and somatic care". Their conclusion isn't that the transition is causing depression, but rather that the transition doesn't solve the underlying depression and more needs to be done to address this issue after reassignment surgery. 

On the flip side, I have found studies from both the NIH and the JAMA that suggest that transitioning does provide a slight decrease in suicidal tendencies. I'm trying not to give these studies too much weight as there is definitely the possibility of ideological bias in these large institutions. I just want to know if there is a solid, peer-reviewed study that would refute the NIH and JAMA studies.It isn't, if it were, medical consensus about this issue wouldn't be what it is.Exactly, its anti-science. Science needs free speech.At first I thought Jordan’s interpretation of C16 was a real stretch, but when he brought it up in debates, plenty of people on the other side agreed with his interpretation and said he was guilty of hate speech. 

They could have won the debate on the spot by saying “compelled speech is wrong, and I would support an addendum to C16 that explicitly says the changes can’t be interpreted to compel speech.” 

To me, this says they want to keep their options open, and no one has to be arrested for it to be effective (although certainly they could start arresting people given how many people agree with Jordan’s interpretation and want to arrest people for misgendering). The University of Toronto took action against JBP and indicated they agreed with his interpretation, and he was at disciplinary risk if he didn’t use pronouns correctly, so it’s plenty effective in other ways.>That's not what C-16 did. This is reflected in the fact that no one has been arrested or imprisoned for refusing to use a person's preferred pronouns.

People may not have been arrested, but from what I understand, people can be fired for not using preferred pronouns. If that is the case, then it is certainly not in the realm of free speech. Also, this YouTube video about the bill says that it does indeed make it a criminal offense to "spread hate propaganda," against transgenders. I have a problem with that, because merely questioning trans ideology and whether someone is a woman simply because they identify as such has been considered "hate" by some transgenders. Skip to 2:08 for the part that mentions the criminalization part.

You are correct that Jungian "psychology" is not science but rather philosophical doctrine. Jordan is a scientist and he said so, and also called himself a philosopher. A person can be a philosopher and a scientist at the same time. If you google what degrees Jordan Peterson has, it says he is a major in psychology, which is a science, and a minor in philosophy.Trans people are around 1% of the population, even less of them have surgery, even less of them are kids who have surgery. Yet it's a topic pushed to the national spotlight by conservatives for political purposes

These people don't want the stoplight, they want to live their lives. So I don't know why a percentage of a percentage of a percentage of people have become a national issue. It's ugly, and the topic should be abandoned.

But it won't be!So, if I'm understanding correctly, you are saying that it's not about "trans people" it's about the ideology behind them?

If I am understanding you correctly:

What about the ideology behind it would be against the 12 rules?

If not:

Maybe I'm having a hard time reading your answer (My first language is spanish)Could you expand on the last sentence a bit more? You seem to be implying that cis people are just "uncomfortable" with the existence of trans people. Though I may well be entirely misinterpreting that.>The debate is about concepts.  Literal people are sometimes a segue but rarely the actual subject of the conversation.

It was a literal person when JP went against Elliot Page and his doctors.I don't think thats true. I don't think you are trying to understand the position of the opposite side of your way of thinkingI don’t think he should be a liar, you’re missing my point. It’s a shame his “truth” turned out to be transphobic conservative mumbo jumbo, that’s what I’m worried about. He always had that radical conservatism in him and that’s fine, what isn’t fine is that at this point he’s doing more harm than good and alienating a sizeable chunk of his followers. I mean, come on guys. Daily wire. The Ben Shapiro place. That is cringe, I have no other word for it. In the past the “pseudo-intellectual” label often attributed to jp was unfair, nowadays though? People around you reflect who you are, and I don’t like the people jp is hanging with nowadays.Would you consider it harassment if someone calls you a different pronoun than you're used to, assuming you're a guy, if someone calls you with she/her, would it not be insulting?

Misgendering intentionally is insulting the person.So if your bossing coworkers continually intentionally misgender you, how long before it starts to get under your skin? How many times do you have to explain it to your customers/new coworkers before you just quit?The science actually disagrees with you. [Trans people live longer, happier, and healthier lives after receiving gender affirming care](https://whatweknow.inequality.cornell.edu/topics/lgbt-equality/what-does-the-scholarly-research-say-about-the-well-being-of-transgender-people/)>My simple question is; what event, study (empirical), etc occurred that changed the accepted treatment for a mental illness from therapies to surgeries?

There are[several studies](https://whatweknow.inequality.cornell.edu/topics/lgbt-equality/what-does-the-scholarly-research-say-about-the-well-being-of-transgender-people/) showing the efficacy of transitioning for trans people.

>What event (might be the same one, or different) caused our society (i should say “some parts of our society) to accept the idealization of a mental illness?

Who is idealizing mental illness? If someone was idealizing it, they wouldn't get treatment. You can't have it both ways.

>And I’ll add that while there has been a huge push to make sure that gender dysphoria is no longer labeled as a mental illness, almost all descriptions about it say it entails emotional discomfort, anxiety, and unease… All of which are mental health issues.

Most trans people and medical organizations consider it to be a mental illness, the problem is that right wing activists use that as a point against transitioning. Apparently mentally ill people cannot make choices for themselvesIt doesn’t matter if you think it’s wrong. They are real so you have to accept that people exist with identities that you don’t agree withBecause being trans and being an alcoholic are the same thing?Yea they are, they think they’re wrong therefore they think I’m a perfect world they shouldn’t existBut there are witnesses who may be emboldened into standing up for truth or at least the right to be wrong.No, because they're suffering from BIID, which doesn't get alleviated after amputating their arm. We don't actually know how to cure it, so CBT would be the best course of action.I think the push makes perfect sense because the goal is to rub it in your face that your outdated beliefs that dehumanize LGBTQ people are on the way out. You can throw a fit over it, but it's going the way of the dinosaur one way or the other. We'll stop celebrating Pride month when conservatives secede into their own white theocratic ethnostate.I heard an advertisement talk about Christmas in fucking June. I dont think its portional.

Gallup estimates that 7% of the US population identify as LGBT.

Roughly 12% of the US population are Black Americans.

2% of the US population are Jewish.How is your comment related to OP's question in any way? Being trans is not an idea, letting people be themselves as long as they're not harming others is not a bad idea.

If you'd read history, you'd know that the Nazis first victimized and eliminated trans people.I'm more than happy to inform you. Hopefully this dispels for you the incorrect, propagandist, cynical notion that the hatred of my trans friends has anything to do with kids!

Yes, that is true.

>They're teaching kids that not fitting into stereotypes and/or normal teenage awkwardness are signs that you need sex change surgery and pills.

>They're teaching kids that women are physically equal to men and that men vs women in sports is a fair competition.

Where?

>NYC spent $200k in a year for drag queen performances at public schools.

Drag is an artform and as long as it is appropriate, what's the issue?You think trans ideology is putting tomboys on T?

This is just a strawman, GD is a lot more than what someone likes or dislikes.trans women involved in competitive sports is a fraction of a fraction of the population.           

it’s unlikely your daughter will ever meet a trans woman, let alone be in a change room in front of one.           

no trans woman has ever won a gold medal at the olympics even though they’ve been allowed to compete since 2003. it isn’t an issue in high level sportsHer son affirming his own gender outside of the scope of her parenting is not the same thing as the government changing his sex. Do your parents own you? He has every right to decide for himself who he is. The school has no reason to inform her without his consent, because there's risk of abuse. These policies exist to protect children from their parents. Do you think abusive parents don't exist? Religious parents have abused, thrown out and sometimes even killed their LGBT children.Yes it is. The distinction is completely made up. You’re just saying words.What? What does talking to a person have to do with anything?I know alpha and beta males, I don't know what sigma males are?

I heard the term, but I don't know if they are like up or down the "chain"

And I get what you are saying. I have the same experience. But I think that the 12 rules could apply to anyone. Don't you agree?

Also, I think there has been a different tone in the recent stuff that Jordan Peterson has been saying. I remember him saying that he would respect the pronoun of the person speaking to him if the person would ask respectfully. I'm not getting the same messages from him lately. What do you think about this?> Thats mainly jp.

Check what sub you're on.  

>Not the users here and rad cons in general.

Cite anything specific whatsoever.  

>What is a woman isn't called 

Not Peterson's film.  The debate about bathroom safety is asymmetric because it revolves around males in females spaces.  This topic is not and has never been a focus of Peterson or of this sub (if you disagree, cite something).

What you are saying is equivalent to regarding discussions about sexual assault or violence "phobias about men in particular".But I also see this happening on the left discourse. No political side is talking about the things that men and trans men seems to be going through.

At least on the mainstrean side, no left influencer side is talking about the issues of trans men. It's always about transwoman

Maybe both side are misoginistic? 

I'm curios about the more common transitioning person is. Are there more trans women or trans men?Yes, you’re right, this explains quite a lot about men not accepting ‘no, we don’t want you here’.Tell me you’re an American without telling me… I’m for lesbians not being coerced to sleep with men, I am against surrogacy, which is slavery; I’m against gender stereotypes, against women being prostituted, …

And about neutral bathrooms: I’m for third spaces, I’m against any scenario that allows males access to women’s spaces.then continue to leave us alonecan you elaborate on “rounding up minorities”?Yes.  If he had been like that when I first encountered him, I would have immediately walked away.  However, because I encountered him before he became so flippant about so many things, I look past it.  But this behavior does plant seeds of skepticism next to his tree of credibility.Do you have a problem with what Musk does on Twitter? because Musk says similar things.Very true, his information is best conveyed in medium/long form. His tweets make him seem like the alt right villain everyone wants him to be. Unfortunate.You quoted the scientific establishment. I am not talking about evidence from  the bribed and bought scientific establishment. I am talking evidence from trans and detrans people. Chloe Cole said her depression worsened after she transitioned because she realized her body was irreversibly messed up. In case you think she is an exception since she detransitioned, there are trans examples too. A detrans dude I follow on YouTube said he talked to lots of trans people privately, including ones who are happily transitioned in public, and found that none of them are happily transitioned in private, and many of them were even considering detransitioning. Most of them were skeptical of the transition process.> but I'm not seeing anything that says that suicidal tendencies increase after reassignment.

There are studies that show gender dysphoric individuals who engage/start the transition process are more suicidal than those who do not.  

I don't necessarily thing that result would hold up to further research....but its an indication that the data and methods are probably a hot mess. 

If I find the paper I'll circle back.I have absolutely no idea what you mean by that.Please recall that C-16 is an expansion of the existing Canadian human rights code to one more marginalized group. Do people in Canada go to jail for speaking racial slurs or using sexist pejoratives?

If not, why? Is there the possibility of "compelled speech" addressed to people of color or women?

Why should I care what Jordan's former employer said? What does an internal decision at a school have to do with Canadian human rights code?If you watch that interview, you will be disabused of the notion he's a scientist at all.> you are saying that it's not about "trans people" it's about the ideology behind them?

I didn't say ideology or refer to any unified hidden force.  I said this is a hot debate about concepts and ideas.  

The language you use seems to regard this topic as a battle between exactly two sides.  That is not the case however, there are many many different opinions on this issue....and dissent among allies on all sides.  As an aside I don't think 12 rules represents an "ideology"....or at least its less of an ideology (like the scientific method versus than most other systems of belief/action.I just said the debate is about concepts, not people.  

Comfort, security, truth and certainty refers to concepts, not people.That just a prompt for a conversation about gender.  

Nobody cares about much about Page the person.  If Page disappears, those conversations are NOT resolved.It certainly is hateful to misgender trans people and this sub and JP have no qualms in doing so.Trans people have a mental condition called gender dysphoria. Science has proven that if someone has suicidal tendencies, the dopamine rush from transition will eventually fade (est 7-10 years). 

It also proves that most MINORS who have gender dysphoria   are no longer trans one they mature into adulthood and their body obtains a better equilibrium. 

It also proves that gender affirming care comes with a litany of permanent necessary medical upkeep and damage that could drastically shorten one's life. This is especially true of minors. 

There is nothing "longer, happier, and healthier" about it. It's possible a fully developed adult could be happier if they transition.> I accept they exist, I just think they are wrong on a fundamental level.You would be right if compliance was not demanded. Once live and let live is out the window, so is holding one's tongue. I get along fine with transgendered people, it's the crazy ideological cult I shall argue with and never bow to.

Again I accept transgender people exist. That's not what you want from me. You want me to agree transgenderism is right. I do not. That makes you want to punish me because you are a control freak out of some defense mechanism against either reality or masculinity.You’re a fucking loon. 

2+2=5 and it doesn’t matter if you think it’s wrong you have to accept it.How can YOU disagree with me AND believe that I exist?  Are you magic?

Saying somebody's wrong is equivalent to as saying they shouldn't exist....thought nobody ever.  

Give me a break.  You can't deal with being criticized so you escalate to a feigned pseudo-physical attack.Why does "standing up for the truth" matters when all you are doing is making people who think different from you wanting to be farther than you and people who think like you wanting to stand closer to you?

The point of this debates is to bring people who think different to stand closerYeah I agree with that as long as they are not harming others. But it’s gotten to the point of institutional capture. Health organizations are throwing science out the window for the sake of supporting trans identities. There is a big difference between someone who is trans and wants to live their own life versus someone who is trans and is selling it as the savior for kids with mental health issues. 

The way the left wing ideology has been pushed is harming many many children. 

And if you’d read history, you’d know that hitler used real injustices to appeal to the people and framed it in the context of love. It doesn’t start by immediately dehumanizing people. It starts by telling the population that they are victims, then it blames their situation on a class of people. 

Here are some hitler quotes for example:

“Two millions have remained on the field of battle. They, too, have their rights and not we, the survivors, alone. There are millions of orphans, of cripples, of widows in our midst. They, too, have rights. For the Germany of today not one of them died, not one of them became a cripple, an orphan, or a widow. We owe it to these millions that we build a new Germany!”

“Further, there must be a reform in our law. Our present law regards only the rights of the individual. It does not regard the protection of the race, the protection of the community of the people. It permits the befouling of the nation's honor and of the greatness of the nation. A law which is so far removed from the conception of the community of the people is in need of reform.”

“There are three words which many use without a thought which for us are no catch- phrases: Love, Faith, and Hope.”

“When the eyes of German children look questioning into ours, when we see the suffering and distress of millions of our fellow-countrymen who without any fault of theirs have fallen into this frightful misfortune, then we laugh at the curses of the whole world, if from these curses there issues the freedom of our race.”somebody’s riled up. I’ll check it out. thanks!

edit: wow. 0 outright bans included. 0! The worst case scenario - Florida, requires “gender affirming care” to be prescribed by a DOCTOR. gasp! A nurse practitioner cannot sign off on it—only a doctor. not a ban.

Now to be fair - no adult should need a prescription of any kind for anything. It’s your body, and you should be able to get dilaudid, estrogen, testosterone, and replace your penis with james bond style watch laser, for all I care, but the medical industrial complex is another conversation entirely.Steroid users are a fraction of the population. It's still not OK for them to cheat in sports. No one should have to be cheated.

Men have won 29 women's championships in the past decade. And that's just CHAMPIONSHIPS. How many women and girls have been knocked off the podium in smaller events? How many women and girls have been knocked out of the top 8 and lost their chance to compete in a state or regional championship because men were allowed to compete? How many women and girls have quit their sport because of this, or because they can't use the locker room without a man watching them change?

The number might not be in the millions, but it's still a significant number of women and girls being screwed over by this desperation to please men.

\> it isn’t an issue in high level sports

[Simply not true.](https://uploads.ovarit.com/48effdda-0b41-5f0d-aabb-41e015336770.jpg) In a three month period, 7 men won women's titles in a single sport. Women being cheated is happening on a  regular basis now. Just because you don't care about it doesn't mean it doesn't matter.It’s government—a public school in California has the authority of the state to transition a minor without parental consent or knowledge. That is what is happening right now.

It’s not about “owning” like a slave—it’s that minors do not have certain rights until they are adults. And parents have rights over their children until their children are adults. That’s why taking children away from parents is a judicial process—they have rights. 

Does a school teacher have the right to convert a child to their religion without the parents consent, yet alone body mutilation and hormone blockers, etc.? 

Abusive parents exist all over—that has nothing to do with parental rights. We don’t take away all kids from their parents because one parent does something wrong.Yes, gender is made up, we made the distinction to point that out.

Its like saying misogyny doesn't exist because it is made up.That is what Peterson says he is unable to do if he doesn’t know how to properly stereotype someone by gender, in the video I linkedas of right now a sigma male is the highest on the totem i believe. 

peterson’s 12 rules are definitely applicable to everyone , i agree.

and i have definitely noticed a change in peterson’s beliefs. i think it’s just a classic case of someone being shaped by the crowd. peterson says one thing and there are minor claps , he then says another and there are major claps. this happens all the time. i believe he himself stated that HITLER was literally shaped by a crowd and used a similar example as i just did. [peterson describes hitler and the crowd](https://youtu.be/6dwsYWF7TXI) around 3 minutes and 40 seconds.I'm taking about the user generated content.

Not jp, I was actually going to say in my first comment there is a distinction between jp and people obsessed with trans women. Based on his track record of being more balanced and obviously not just focused on trans women.If trans men were being attacked they would be.

Women stated x dressing in the 60s. Wearing pants, boyish hair cuts.

They weren't being beaten up or harassed by police like men with long hair were.

A trans man has been beating male opponents in fighting. Not a word about it from the conservative hate and outrage machine .> no left influencer side is talking about the issues of trans men. It's always about transwoman

Elliot Page is a trans man and talks about trans men's issues, but mostly trans men don't have mainstream issues like trans women who have the spotlight.

Ideally nobody should have issues, but trans women are overrepresented due to the same reasons as the commenter listed, which is why there is a lot of defense for trans women from the left and thus discourse.Just curious, what do you mean when you say surrogacy is slavery? I’m fairly certain surrogates are compensated financially for their pregnancy and deliveryI'm not American. If you are a women's acrivist you will have a track record ofbthe same views when it's not trans women.. and you would also be concerned about gay men, and women being coerced into sleeping with trans man.

Its all just front for bigotry .Why can't you leave other people alone?

Why do you demand acceptance on "neopronouns", gender care for minors when the research in Europe has shown how harmful puberty blockers are, sports participation when the science isn't on your side?

The whole "groomer" shit is overblown minus the radical exceptions but conceding these points isn't going to allow Conservative fascism.Yeah, Musk is an absolute clown on Twitter.So you'd believe anecdote and hearsay over a body of evidence that spans several decades? All becuase you thibk that people who spent almost a decade studying and learning just to enter their feild would all universally lie? 


Come on dude.Medical consensus is that transitioning best for trans people.Because they told him if he didn’t allow his speech to be compelled per the C16 changes, he’d be disciplined. 

There’s a difference between I can’t use a slur and I have to use a pronoun. One is prohibiting speech, the other compelling it.

The point is: it doesn’t matter if you are convinced, people agree with his interpretation and want him arrested.>I didn't say ideology or refer to any unified hidden force. I said this is a hot debate about concepts and ideas.

You are right, sorry for the misundertanding

>The language you use seems to regard this topic as a battle between exactly two sides

I'm trying to understand why this community cares so much about this stuff, when I thought that the Jordan Peteron's community would be all about self improvement. (And I don't thinkg the subreddit is about that)

>As an aside I don't think 12 rules represents an "ideology"....or at least its less of an ideology (like the scientific method versus than most other systems of belief/action.

Yes, I agree with you. It shouldn't be seen as an ideology. Maybe more of a philosophy? A way of life?

I don't know how to call it. Ideology seemed fine to me, but how would you describe it?>....this is about the perceived security, psychological comfort, and relationship with the "truth" of mostly (because of demographics) regular gender/sex conforming people.

I cannot parse what this phrase is trying to say. Your follow up comment seems to be distancing your argument from the inclusion of any people (cis or trans), but this bit specifically mentions cis people. On that note, comfort, security, truth, and certainty surely are concepts, but in a void they are meaningless. Comfort and security of whom? Truth and certainty about what?I think it is more hateful and cruel to lie to a person who is suffering from any kind of disphoria. Affirmation, in the future, will be considered the opposite of what it is considered today, which is a default position. I think it is a categorizational error. These people are not the opposite sex but merely the opposite of what society claims is a masculine or feminine trait. In other words, they are not the gender they are claiming they are.. as there is no such thing.. they are merely a feminine man or a manly woman,  and there is nothing wrong with that.
Once everybody wakes up to this fact, maybe we can make some progress.
This correlates with the claim JP makes about young detransitioners, among other demographics in the trans community.. that they would have just turned out to be a homosexual if not for the indoctrination of the trans ideology.. aka cult.has anyone gone to jail in Canada for misgendering?>Trans people have a mental condition called gender dysphoria.

Or gender dsyphoria is a symptom of being transgender which we've patholgized rather than accepted as a normal (if rare) part of the human experince. 


>Science has proven that if someone has suicidal tendencies, the dopamine rush from transition will eventually fade (est 7-10 years).

The research shows thay the benefits reflect immediately in the patient, and continue to improve for the first ~10 years, after which they tend to plateau. All of which is distinctly different from "fading". 


>There is nothing "longer, happier, and healthier" about it. It's possible a fully developed adult could be happier if they transition.


Reductions in mental illnesses (including depression and anxiety), reductions in risk taking behaviors (including risky sexual encounters, and tobacco use), reduced substance use, and reduction in suicidality (to within a a few percentage points of average) are all hallmarks of a longer, happier and healthier life. 


>It also proves that gender affirming care comes with a litany of permanent necessary medical upkeep and damage that could drastically shorten one's life. This is especially true of minors.


Source?You don’t have to think it’s right. You just have to shut up about it because no one cares about your opinions lolNo It’s gender identity, not math, it doesn’t have to make sense to you. Math ≠ gender/sex identificationIf only gender identity was as rigid as math.

What you're saying is "blue is for boys and you have to accept it even if you think its wrong".They deny their identity and call it mental illness instead of accepting that people who live in a body they don’t like exist. That’s how

It’s pretty simple to explain that 

Why are you getting triggered? LolSome minds are capable of change. Some are not. The point of debates is again to reveal the truth and hopefully reach those who are capable of change or awareness. Many are here because of Jordan Petersons interviews. He didn't change the interviewers mind, he brought us along with his wisdom and arguments.>Health organizations are throwing science out the window for the sake of supporting trans identities.

Now scientists and doctors are wrong about trans people? Who knows more about trans people? Doctors who directly work with hundreds of trans people and study them for a living or you?

>There is a big difference between someone who is trans and wants to live their own life versus someone who is trans and is selling it as the savior for kids with mental health issues.

Can you give some examples for the latter?

Doesn't this sound similar to JP claiming that cis people are the victims of the "trans mob" because free speech or something?

> It does not regard the protection of the race, the protection of the community of the people. It permits the befouling of the nation's honor and of the greatness of the nation. A law which is so far removed from the conception of the community of the people is in need of reform.

Trans identity is unrelated to nationalism, which is what this quote is all about.

>There are three words which many use without a thought which for us are no catch- phrases: Love, Faith, and Hope.

How is this relevant?

>When the eyes of German children look questioning into ours, when we see the suffering and distress of millions of our fellow-countrymen who without any fault of theirs have fallen into this frightful misfortune, then we laugh at the curses of the whole world, if from these curses there issues the freedom of our race.

Still don't know how it is relevantHold on there, sparky. Two things. First, other states also have passed restrictions on gender-affirming care for adults, such as Missouri.

Second, you've moved the goalposts. I pointed out that your latest culture war artifact isn't about protecting kids if it targets adults. You asked for evidence. I provided it. You deflected and said it wasn't that bad, but it's still evidence of targeting adults. Do you agree with me, then, that your effete wailing isn't actually out of concern for kids?>I'm summarizing, they don't make it quite that blatant. But they hand out material like this and show them things like this 

Can you point out what exactly is incorrect or inappropriate about this? What next? They shouldn't teach about the human body?

>which teach that stereotypes, not your body, determine whether you're a boy or a girl.

What stereotypes are shown over there?

>Then you have cases like this teacher telling a 2nd grader he's trans and is going to become a girl - the kid has a medical condition and uses the staff restroom, the teacher assumed this was because he refused to use the boys bathroom due to not identifying as a boy.

Yes, this one case proves your point that "they" are transing your kids.

>Trans activists are fighting to allow men in women's sports and boys in girls sports. 

No? Trans women are not men and trans women cannot compete without going on hormones which does decrease capabilities to an extent.

And kids play co-ed all the time, they're just kids.

>The President of the US tried to overturn Title IX's sex based protections which are what led to women having their own sports leagues in the first place.

Laws get changed all the time based on new information, if there is scientific proof that trans women lose most of their advantage (to an acceptable level) then would you be for trans women in women's sports?

>Children are being told this is how it should be.

Again, where?

You keep showing me random images, i can show you anything and just claim that "they're" teaching this in schools.

Can you show me something in a prescribed syllabus or course or anything tangible?

>Why is it in schools?

Why not? It is entertaining and different from usual.

>Why do men's crossdressing sexual fetishes have to be something taxpayers are funding to be put into classrooms?

It is not a fetish, drag is not sexual at all, the same question could be asked as "why should taxpayers money be used for getting clowns to entertain students?"

>Teacher pay isn't great, teachers are expected to spend a bunch of that on classroom supplies (which unruly students often promptly destroy), some schools are using textbooks that are very outdated, some schools are in serious need of renovation... but no, men in wigs and makeup dancing around has to come first!

You think those drag queens are making bank with school gigs? I've done school gigs as an artist and more often than not, they're not even paid.i didn't realize steroid users were a protected class. in any case, trans women are doing the opposite of taking steroids. they are taking medication that actively makes them weaker.                 

29 trans women in the past *decade?* this is the thing you're worried about? jesus christ.                      

i see your photo with 7 examples of trans women winning a sport, and here's [a study](https://www.cces.ca/sites/default/files/content/docs/pdf/transgenderwomenathletesandelitesport-ascientificreview-e-final.pdf) which analyzed 50 sources to come to the conclusion that trans women are not dominating sports at an elite level. when compared to cis men, trans women were significantly slower and weaker when it came to 100m sprint, cycling, and rowing. it also showed that trans women have equal athletic ability when controlling for variables such as height and weight.                      

also, just as a side note, [evidence suggests](https://outonthefields.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Evaluating-LGBTI-Inclusion-within-Sport-and-the-Pride-Cup-Initiative-final-report.pdf) only 24% of women athletes believe trans women have an unfair advantage, while 45% of men believe this. you're fighting to "protect" a group of women who largely disagree with you.That's your argument? Lol okay.Sigma Males aren't high on the totem, they've dropped out of the game. They are the Obi Wan or the Doctor Who. They are not aggressive, but also not submissive. I've been a Sigma pretty much my entire life, save my teenage years when I was arguably a Beta.Trans women are not even more common than trans men, they just have a harder time passing, which shifts the spotlight onto them. Transmen can just bind get fit and grow a beard with T, and nobody will ever guessThe economic realities of the, more often than not, very poor woman leave them little real choice.

It’s the same issue as the happy hooker: Do they exist? Yes, but they are so rare.Of course, I don’t care if men identify as trans or not: almost all violence is male. This is the issue. Again: no male should gain access to female spaces.

Incel men aren’t trying to force men into sleeping with them, so I’m less concerned about gay men.

And as I’m sure you know female on female violence is extraordinarily rare.if you’re genuinely upset by neopronouns, then you need to go outside. im active in queer communities, both online and in real life, and have never met someone with neopronouns.       

are you just against youth on puberty blockers? or cross sex hormones for youth in general?        

I haven’t seen evidence trans women are dominating sports at an elite level, the majority of women athletes are okay with competing against trans women.         

yes, the groomer shit is overblown, but so are all the issues you brought up. you’re likely never going to meet someone who uses neopronouns, children aren’t getting hormones and gender affirming surgeries in hordes, and trans women aren’t dominating sports. it’s all culture war bullshit that’s conservatives are pushing because they have no actually policy positions other than “trans bad”I am pretty sure you are the type of person Jordan said he has to walk on eggshells around to avoid saying anything that isn't politically incorrect. He hates having to walk on eggshells and because of that he feels much more at home on the right than the left.Well in that case, I agree with most of what Musk tweets. Jordan does do some bad tweets by feeding the trolls, but Musk I haven't seen do that. Musk even said cis is a slur, which it is. Sometimes I tweet about being a proud transphobe or about how dumb climate alarmists like Greta are.do you know what expedient means>Because they told him if he didn’t allow his speech to be compelled per the C16 changes, he’d be disciplined.

Please show verbatim where they said this.

>There’s a difference between I can’t use a slur and I have to use a pronoun

The only possibilities are that either pronouns are compelled speech for everybody, trans and cis alike, or not compelled for anybody. Let me explain:

Option 1: Pronouns are compelled speech for everybody, both trans and cis alike. Try engaging in a deliberate pattern of misgendering your boss and tell me how it goes. If option 1 is the case then C-16 just expands to trans people a protection that cis people already have (this is an issue that transphobic policymakers are repeatedly running into in the judicial system btw)

Option 2: Pronouns are not compelled for anybody. Nobody's forcing you to use a pronoun. You could be quiet instead.

>people agree with his interpretation and want him arrested.

Very frankly, I don't believe you. Show me the police report that someone has filed because of Jordan's speech.> I'm trying to understand why this community cares so much about this stuff

Peterson wrote a book called "Maps of Meaning" and has done quite a bit of research in the areas of personality and personal narrative.  

The questions of perception and categorization are very important to Peterson's work.  Also, emotional regulation and social/political catastrophe.  

The current debate over the objectivity and subjectivity of sex and gender touches on many of these fundamental issues.  

>I don't know how to call it. Ideology seemed fine to me, but how would you describe it?

I think the distinction between ideological and non-ideological systems of thought is very important to Peterson's work...and he should spend more time discussing this explicitly.  Here is a link to an article that discusses the particular features of "ideology" as opposed to other systems.  

https://www.britannica.com/topic/ideology-society> Your follow up comment seems to be distancing your argument from the inclusion of any people (cis or trans)

Because both cis and trans people argue about these issues.  

>but this bit specifically mentions cis people. 

Becasue they make up the vast majority of the population.  

>Comfort and security of whom? 

Of everyone.  

>Truth and certainty about what?

About (i) the relationship between sex and gender, (ii) the innateness or malleability of various aspect of our personality, (iii) the degree to which social conventions are arbitrary or emerge from biology.

Certainty about these concepts can affect our (cis and trans) emotional state, our outlook for the future, our evaluation of the meaning of our lives and our relationships.  In other words....people CARE about the trans debate because its touches issues that are fundamental to our sense of meaning....but they primarily care about concepts rather than people.  That is, in the absence of actual transgendered persons the concepts would still be troubling and controversial.>I think it is more hateful and cruel to lie to a person who is suffering from any kind of disphoria. Affirmation, in the future, will be considered the opposite of what it is considered today, which is a default position.

Affirmation has been around for a century now, you think if it didn't work, people would stop doing it.

> These people are not the opposite sex but merely the opposite of what society claims is a masculine or feminine trait. In other words, they are not the gender they are claiming they are.. as there is no such thing.. they are merely a feminine man or a manly woman, and there is nothing wrong with that.

Doesn't explain masculine trans women and feminine trans men.

You think you know about someone's gender identity so much more than they do?

Don't you think just being a feminine man would be easier than being a trans woman?

> This correlates with the claim JP makes about young detransitioners, among other demographics in the trans community..

Detransitioners are 1% of a community that is already at 1% of the population. You don't make judgements based on 1% of the community, you're just looking at confirmation bias at this point.

>that they would have just turned out to be a homosexual if not for the indoctrination of the trans ideology.. aka cult.

Doesn't explain lesbian trans women and gay trans men.

You don't need to believe anything to be trans, you just are, hence it is not a cult.Robert Hoogland

https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/father-jailed-defy-court-order-discuss-gender-transition"Or gender dysphoria is a assumption of being tens." Now you are talking in circles and restating my point.  Mental illness is a normal part of the human experience,  and is accrued when properly treated instead of romanticized. 


You're trying to incorrectly argue semantics.  The benefits,  if you want to call it that,  clearly decline rapidly over time. And those "immediate benefits" is the previously mentioned dopamine rush. 

Yet again,  stating my point,  reckless behavior does not treat  mental illness.  Going through sex change at a low point in life and now that it's trendy is Clearly reckless. 

Source to prove there are life long complications? Start with the side effects of the hormone blockers. The rising cases of early onset osteoporosis,  infections,  dysfunctional genitalia,   people pressured to transition as minors s coming out with their regrets aren't enough for you?It’s an analogy. 

You are saying something that is demonstrably false and insisting that someone accept it. You do not get to play gender cosplay based on how you feel, and insist people affirm it.It’s probably not AS rigid, but xx and xy chromosomes are pretty rigid as far as these things go I’d imagine.I can deny an identity and accept a person's existence at the same time.  Just like everybody else.  

Being wrong and existing are different things.   It's simple to explain that.  

>Why are you getting triggered?

You think disagreements are murder.  That's getting triggered.But going all out on being agressive in the way one presents an argument is all that matters when trying to "reveal the truth"

There is no truth revealing if you present your argument like "If you cannot accept what is and are coerced into accepting some delusional paradigm, how can you even have the foundations necessary for meaning?"

Because you ain't giving a margin for you to be wrong. That means that you believe that you are the sole owner of the truth, and that's a pretty big claim to have

If you want to debate someone, you always have to leave room to be wrong

edit: If I go with your definition, your mind doesn't seem to be capable of change... what does that mean?> Can you point out what exactly is incorrect or inappropriate about this? 

A man is an adult human male. A woman is an adult human female. There is no spectrum. You are not more of one (or less of the other) depending on which stereotypes you fit into or what kind of feelings you have. Man and woman aren't defined by stereotypes like GI Joe and Barbie. Your actions and your clothes don't determine if you're a man or a woman.

Being a man or a woman is a physical reality. They're teaching that woman is a costume that men can wear.

> Yes, this one case proves your point that "they" are transing your kids.

It's hardly the only case. They're teaching kids that pretending to be the opposite sex will make it real, encouraging kids to seek sex changes, and hiding this from the parents. It's not a widespread thing happening in every classroom, but the amount of times anything remotely like that should be happening is zero.

> No? Trans women are not men 

Yes. Trans women are men. Pretending to be a woman doesn't make it real. Trans activists fight to allow men like Lia Thomas and Cece Telfer and hundreds of other men and boys to cheat by competing in the women's league.

> and trans women cannot compete without going on hormones which does decrease capabilities to an extent.

First, that's not true. Cece Telfer and others have competed in girls sports in high school without any hormone treatment.

Second, the hormones weaken the men somewhat, but don't come close to eliminating the advantage of the male body. It is a blatant lie when people claim hormone levels are the only thing that matter. If that were true, we wouldn't be seeing dozens of women's sports championships being won by men immediately after transitioning (when they never won anything in the men's league prior to this), while women in the men's sports league never come close to winning anything at all. Anyone can see that the male body matters and the results prove it.

Third, women's sports simply isn't for men. Even if the pills weakened them a lot more, it's still not for them. Would you allow adults to compete on a children's Little League team if the adults took pills to weaken them? I hope not. That league simply isn't for them, regardless of what pills they take or what they pretend to be.

> Laws get changed all the time based on new information

There is no new information that justifies allowing men into women's sports.

> if there is scientific proof that trans women lose most of their advantage (to an acceptable level) then would you be for trans women in women's sports?

No, because men should compete in the men's league. The women's league isn't for men, it's just for women.

> It is not a fetish

[Sure it's not.](https://twitter.com/Dominiquetaegon/status/1630948003962912768) This is [totally not a sexual fetish](https://twitter.com/libsoftiktok/status/1631313549204094982) for these nearly naked men. Not sexual at all! Family friendly entertainment!

> You think those drag queens are making bank with school gigs?

They got $200k of taxpayer money that could have gone to about a thousand more productive uses.It doesn't matter who is considered a protected class, it's cheating and it's wrong. Cheating shouldn't be allowed.

29 sports championships were stolen by cheaters. Far more victories in small events were stolen by cheaters. This is not OK. Cheating is unfair and harms people. Why are you defending cheating? Why do you want to mock someone for supporting fairness?

\> here's a study which analyzed 50 sources to come to the conclusion that trans women are not dominating sports 

So what? It's true that cheaters aren't dominating all of women's sports and winning every single championship. How does that make cheating any more acceptable? If someone broke into your house and stole your property, is that OK because they didn't steal absolutely everything?

\> only 24% of women athletes believe trans women have an unfair advantage

I don't care what uninformed people believe, I care about what's true. Men are advantaged over women and it's cheating for them to compete against women instead of competing against other men.He is the topic of this sub tho, no?Nah most violence starts in the home with the main care giver. Men who have issues with women were abused as children. Physically  psychologically and or emotionally. And visa versa.

If we follow your logic to its terf conclusion men and women should be kept separate altogether.Are you a professional liar or something?

>children aren’t getting hormones and gender affirming surgeries in hordes,

Oh, yeah? Planned parenthood doesn't go by the "informed consent" model do they? You do realize a California plaintiff is suing over two minors getting double mastectomies? 

"Neopronouns" fall under the "gender spectrum" train of thought. A sociological theory that is bullshit.I'm cool with pretty much anything anyone says. I'm always down for debate.

But there is a difference between that and being called out for acting out like a child.There’s lots of things I can’t do to my boss that aren’t illegal. I went nearly ten years being called a derogatory nickname, no one was compelled to use my name, and it wasn’t the end of the world. There were some short periods where I was misgendered too, but I learned how to earn the trust of those that were testing me and they stopped. In hindsight, I’m very grateful that no one made it a law to call me by my “proper” pronoun or name. It helped me become stronger and more accountable, and it wouldn’t bother me in the least if someone refused to call me “he” today because it’s just a fact that I’m a man. 

Do you support compelled speech?>Peterson wrote a book called "Maps of Meaning" and has done quite a bit of research in the areas of personality and personal narrative.

>The questions of perception and categorization are very important to Peterson's work. Also, emotional regulation and social/political catastrophe.

But he was also very open to the idea of another person identifying itself as another gender and respecting it.

Now it seems that it changed to become the main topic of his ideology

> https://www.britannica.com/topic/ideology-society

I tried to read that article, but I think its way above what I can understand. Maybe you can help me get the main idea of it?

It gets on about the ethimological meaning and practical meaning of the word "ideology". I don't think that's what I asked you.

 And Ideology to me is a group of ideas that is meant to be applied in the practical world. The "12 rules" proposes a way of living that can be applied to the real world, leaving behind all politics (no matter the spectrum you find yourself)Oh sure. Thanks for the clarification.

I do question how you would remove the concept of trans-ness from the trans debate and still have it be "troubling and controversial" but yeah I think I understand what you're getting at now.this isn’t a simple case of misgendering. he was publicly talking to news outlets about stopping his sons transition. [this article](https://globalnews.ca/news/6399468/bc-gender-change-court/) goes into more detail. the boy already got written consent from his mother and other psychologists to medically transition, and the father continued to to publicly try to stop the transition entirely> Source to prove there are life long complications? Start with the side effects of the hormone blockers. The rising cases of early onset osteoporosis, infections, dysfunctional genitalia, people pressured to transition as minors s coming out with their regrets aren't enough for you?

No, because only one of us has provided actual studies to justify their points. Even your arguments about regret are unfounded [and represent 1-2% of all people who transition](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8099405/).


>You're trying to incorrectly argue semantics.

No. I'm trying to point out that it's the same mistake we've made in the past about homosexuality. A perfectly normal part of the human experince that we pathologize because our brains are basically patterning machines and we find a rare (but normal) part of the human experince to be uncomfortable.

 
>The benefits, if you want to call it that, clearly decline rapidly over time. And those "immediate benefits" is the previously mentioned dopamine rush.

Cite your sources or gtfo.It’s not false. Gender is subjective. It’s only false from your limited view. To everyone else it’s demonstrably realThere are chromosomal variations beyond XX and XY.

Nowhere in math is 2+2=5, but there is no such thing as a rigid classification in biology, any attempt to classify things would just reveal more and more outliers.I didn’t compare anything to murder you weirdo> I can deny an identity and accept a person's existence at the same time.  Just like everybody else.

You can't deny an integral part of someone's identity and still claim that you're accepting.But it is the truth. How does one talk about color without a solid truth on color? How does one talk about literature without a solid truth on the formation of words and sentences?

The truth of gender is not mine. The definition of gender in 1900 was sex. We've had a universally accepted truth on gender for 2000 years despite the odd example with is the exception and not the rule. Am I not giving a margin in this? Maybe not because sex is a concrete thing. It's a truth that should not even need to be revealed. 

The grey area is whether accepting the truth or living a lie is better. Maybe I'm wrong and it's better for some to embrace the identity of something they are not.>A man is an adult human male. A woman is an adult human female. There is no spectrum. 

Do you have a scientific source for that?

>You are not more of one (or less of the other) depending on which stereotypes you fit into or what kind of feelings you have. 

Not stereotypes, but feelings yes.

>Man and woman aren't defined by stereotypes like GI Joe and Barbie. Your actions and your clothes don't determine if you're a man or a woman.

They don't, no trans person ever said they did.

>Being a man or a woman is a physical reality. They're teaching that woman is a costume that men can wear.

No, being a man is a feeling, being male is physical reality, and they're not teaching that, rather being accepting of people who don't feel like they're the gender they were born as.

>They're teaching kids that pretending to be the opposite sex will make it real

No pretending, if you feel like you are a woman, you probably are.

>encouraging kids to seek sex changes, and hiding this from the parents. 

Where?

Yes, ideally, but can you show me one case of "encouraging kids to seek sex changes, and hiding this from the parents." happening?

>Yes. Trans women are men. Pretending to be a woman doesn't make it real.

Trans women are women no matter how you feel about it, they are not pretending to be women.

>Trans activists fight to allow men like Lia Thomas and Cece Telfer and hundreds of other men and boys to cheat by competing in the women's league.

They are not men, they're trans women, who are women, while there is a discussion to be had about trans women in sports, that can be done without spreading misinformation about trans people.

>Cece Telfer and others have competed in girls sports in high school without any hormone treatment.

Can you show me one case of a trans woman winning anything that wasn't a men's champion?

> while women in the men's sports league never come close to winning anything at all.

Trans men are winning in the men's league, they're not women, they are men, you're just wrong.

Why not? if they were in the same level, why shouldn't they compete?

Also are you comparing women to children?

>There is no new information that justifies allowing men into women's sports.

We are not talking about men, we are talking about trans women, and there is some evidence that trans women lose muscle mass and strength after going on HRT.

>They got $200k of taxpayer money that could have gone to about a thousand more productive uses.

This does seem productive, since it is entertaining.> A man is an adult human male. A woman is an adult human female. There is no spectrum.

First, can you provide a single scientific source that backs this claim?

Dictionaries are not scientific sources, they're just compilations of words with the most common definitions.how is it cheating when the hormones they take actively make them weaker than cis men? you would see how much hormones inhibit athletic ability if you read the study i linked, which i assume you didnt. you keep talking about how unfair it is for trans women to compete with cis women, but it would be much more unfair for trans women to compete with/against cis men. the athletic ability between trans women and cis men is vastly different from the difference between trans women and cis women. trans women would be dead weight competing in men's sports. trans women's athletic ability is much closer to cis women's than cis men's.              

>So what?                    

because you're talking about how dominant trans women are in sports, but only cited less than 30 wins in a decade. and completely ignoring trans women winning zero gold medals in the decades they were allowed in the Olympics. so, you realize that's a miniscule amount of "domination" from this super scary group of trans women, so you also throw in how "well, they're also probably winning lots of smaller competitions!" with absolutely zero sources.              

so, what, you're talking about trans youth in sports? because, depending what age they started transitioning, they could have little to no advantage in any sport. especially if they started puberty blockers early and completely skipped male puberty. if that were the case, would you *still* have a problem with them competing with other girls? correct me if im wrong, but you're probably against kids transitioning anyways, so i assume you just dont want these trans kids to exist at all.           

biological difference exist for all sports. 10 percent of women have polycystic ovarian syndrome, which results in elevated testosterone levels, which could give them advantage over women who naturally produce less testosterone, and even an advantage over trans women who produce the same amount of testosterone as a cis woman. in fact, in the past, women with higher testosterone than average have been banned. [just look at Caster Semenya.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caster_Semenya) she was born intersex, and naturally produced more testosterone. one of the competitors said, "These kind of people should not run with us. For me, she's not a woman. She's a man." Semenya got her gold medal taken away from her. does this seem fair to you? they were born women, after all, and have an innate biological advantage. to quote [this paper:](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3538474/)

>What if swimmer Michael Phelps' disproportionately long arms and overly lax joints preempted him from swimming races because they give him a reach and flexibility that deprive shorter-armed, more tightly jointed contestants of victory? The Australian champion swimmer Ian Thorpe is celebrated for huge, flipperlike feet that power him through the pool, and Olympic gold medalist basketballer Kevin Garnett has speed, agility, and jumping ability that seem incongruous with his immense height. Similarly, cyclist Lance Armstrong has a preternaturally high maximum oxygen consumption and superbly efficient oxygen use, and one of the greats of women's volleyball, the late Flo Hyman, had Marfan syndrome that gave her the tall stature and long arms that likely contributed to her success. Should they be ousted for possessing their distinctive edges? As of early 2011, Ethiopians and Kenyans, with their slight, lithe physiques and exposure to high altitudes, had run 41 of the 50 fastest marathons in history. Should East Africans be excluded to give long-distance runners from other parts of the world more of a chance?                    

biological advantages are just a part of sports.

>I don't care what uninformed people believe, I care about what's true.          

and *you* are more informed than the women who actually compete against and with trans women? because you saw some tweets about how strong and unbeatable trans women how? how can you genuinely say you know more than the people who the topic *directly affects?*                

just admit it isn't about fairness. it's about transphobia. there are some cis women who have to compete against cis women even though the trans women aren't winning. a few girls in California [sued to block trans women from competing against them.](https://apnews.com/article/danbury-us-news-ap-top-news-hartford-sports-general-8fd300537131153cc44e0cf2ade3244b) do you know what happened next?

That doesn't mean I have to agree with everything he says. You are having a discussion with me, not him.I don’t care what other ways you choose to slice it: Most violence comes from males and is directed at females.are *you* a professional liar? [planned parenthood](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/planned-parenthood-mar-monte/patient-resources/gender-affirming-care) only offers informed consent to people over the age of 18, and people 16-17 need parental consent to begin gender affirming hormone surgery.              

in [this study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8099405/) that analyzed regret rate for trans youth and adults, round 1% of people regretted it. it seems ridiculous to ban a treatment because it didnt work for 1/100 peopleSome of the people he calls out for acting like spoiled children really are acting line spoiled children. One trans person who acts like a child says that HE identifies as a woman and will use whatever bathroom he F\*\*\*\*\*\*\* feels like using and nobody is going to stop him. He even called for the trans to take up arms with guns over that. If he doesn't deserve to be called out, then what does?>There’s lots of things I can’t do to my boss

Then we agree that some speech is, at some level, compelled, and that C-16 just expands those existing social mores to a group that should be included in them.

Either way, your personal anecdote, while unfortunate, is a poor substitute for an actual argument.

I'll also note that you didn't respond to most of what I said. You claimed that Peterson's opponents agree with his view but want him arrested, yet can produce no evidence for this claim. Should I view that as a concession, that you acknowledge you were wrong?> But he was also very open to the idea of another person identifying itself as another gender and respecting it.

I don't observe a change here.  From what I know his use of pronouns has not changed.  

He talks about policy more...but as far as "being open" to other's defining their own identity I think he has not changed. 

>Now it seems that it changed to become the main topic of his ideology

What ideology?  An ideology is (roughly):  A set of ideas about the way the world should be organized socially/politically AND the methods to achieve that organization. 

Making a declaration about the category of gender or category of sex isn't necessarily ideological....its observation, not advocacy....similar to the way that scientific observations are not "ideological".   

>The "12 rules" proposes a way of living that can be applied to the real world, leaving behind all politics

It is NOT ideological mostly because it eschews politics as you note.  The ideas are targeted toward controlling the behavior of others or society at large.   They are personal rules for personal thriving.   

Note that often this debate centers around one side prescribing specific actions or requirements (pronoun usage, admittance to restricted spaces etc) whereas the other side insists on the personal right to assent or decline to engage....or to "conserve" traditional organization (sex specific spaces, which are more of a human universal than a novel political proposal).> I do question how you would remove the concept of trans-ness from the trans debate and still have it be "troubling and controversial"

I think the relationship between biology and personality, and the problems of categorization of sex and gender could still be controversial without the phenomenon of "trans people". 

Additionally, as a thought experiment let's say that temporarily the population of trans individuals dropped to zero...its not like we would just forget the concept.  It could still be debated among cis people.His daughter’s transition…

The court determined that referring to her by her biological pronouns was “a form of family violence” and he was ordered to stop. And he was jailed for, among other things, referring to her using her female pronouns. 

That is the “compelled speech” that JP is vehemently opposed to. And I agree with him. 

My two cents: as her father, Mr. Hoogland wasn’t wrong to try and stop his daughter from mutilating herself.You can start by citing your sources because you are defying all common sense.It’s really not though. Simply saying it is doesn’t make it so.Those variations are considered abnormalities. Genetic defects. And they are also very rare. Most “trans” people do not have such abnormalities.Causing somebody to not exist ("denying existence") would be murder under most circumstances.  On the softer side, I have routinely heard "denying THE existence" of something equated to "erasure" and "murder"....in the same way that "eliminating transgenderism" has been equated to genocide.  

Comparisons aside, you do think that I bet.  It's your ideas that are weird, not my description of them.  

To equate disagreement with "denying existence" is absolute batshit.Yes I can absolutely accept somebody existence even if they are wrong about one fact or another.  

Its simple to explain that.> Not stereotypes, but feelings yes.

Woman is not a feeling a man can have. Woman is not a costume a man can wear. A woman is an adult human female.

> They don't, no trans person ever said they did.

Those charts appear to be saying that. And I've seen dozens of trans people say "I knew I was a girl because I always wanted to have long hair and wear dresses" and other stereotype-based comments like that.

> No, being a man is a feeling

No it's not. A man is an adult human male. It is not valid to make up new definitions to suit your purposes, especially when doing so infringes on people's rights.

> No pretending, if you feel like you are a woman, you probably are.

What feeling do you believe "woman" is?

> Trans women are women no matter how you feel about it, they are not pretending to be women.

False. They are provably men. Lia Thomas is a male with a dick and balls. He previously competed in the men's league, and while competing in the women's league he exposed his dick and balls to his female teammates. He has not transformed into a woman, and such a thing is not possible in humans.

> I was talking about state level and national level sports.

There's also the fact that men have won dozens of women's sports championships, but zero women have defeated men to win a men's sports championship. It's blatantly clear that the male body advantage matters.

> Can you show me one case of a trans woman winning anything that wasn't a men's champion?

Lia Thomas, Cece Telfer, Mary Gregory, Veronica Ivy, Laurel Hubbard, Andraya Yearwood

> Trans men are winning in the men's league, they're not women, they are men, you're just wrong.

False. There are zero women who have defeated men in sports to win a men's championship. It has never happened.

> https://www.espn.in/boxing/story/_/id/31662608/boxer-patricio-manuel-transgender-pioneer-looking-next-fight

She has three wins in four-round fights against absolute nobodies. While it's somewhat impressive for a woman to defeat any man at all, this is nothing remotely comparable to winning a championship.

Lia Thomas didn't just outswim a few nobodies, he stole the women's national championship. Laurel Hubbard didn't outlift a few nobodies, he stole the gold medal in multiple international competitions.

You know that there are no women doing the equivalent. You know it's only men winning in women's sports and not the other way around. And you know the reason is that men have an advantage over women in sports.

> Why not? if they were in the same level, why shouldn't they compete?

Because the children's league isn't for adults. Not everything is for everyone. Only children are allowed into children's sports, it's not fair to make them compete against adults.

Either you have a severe misunderstanding of sports or you simply don't care about fair competition and who gets harmed by allowing people to compete in the wrong league with an unfair advantage.

> Also are you comparing women to children?

I am comparing the advantage men have over women in sports, to the advantage adults have over children in sports.

If you don't like that comparison, here's another - would you let someone riding a motorcycle into a bicycle race? Would it be OK if he tuned his motorcycle so that it goes the average speed of a racing bike, and no faster?

For anyone who has any sense, the answer would be no. It doesn't matter what excuses he has to justify it, a bike race isn't for motorcycles. Just like children's sports aren't for adults and women's sports aren't for men.

You need to accept the fact that women deserve their own sports leagues and there is no valid reason to allow men to cheat by competing in the women's league.

> We're talking about trans women, not men.

Transwomen are men. They're men pretending to be women. Pretending doesn't make it real. Neither do pills, or surgery, or makeup.  Men cannot transform into women, that's not a real thing that happens.I don't keep a list of basic biology textbooks on hand. It's just what the words mean.

There are two sexes. There are two gametes involved in human reproduction, there is no third gamete. It takes one of each in order to reproduce - reproduction doesn't work with two of the same sex, and there is no third option involved.

For as long as the words have existed, man meant adult human male and woman meant adult human female.

No one was ever confused about the meanings in the past. Back when women didn't have the right to vote, they didn't let women vote if they wore suits, they didn't let women vote if they pretend to be men. Somehow everyone knew it was the adult human females that were excluded.

And somehow the adult human males were allowed to vote, even if they didn't fall into the usual male stereotypes. Somehow the adult human males were the ones drafted into the military. You know why? Because that's what the word "man" means. It's what it has always meant, and what it means today.

I still don't know what kind of point you're trying to get it. Nitpicking definitions and talking about word origins is never going to change the fact that it isn't valid to make up new definitions to benefit yourself.

I can't just say "I decided that a new definition of doctor is anyone who thinks medicine is interesting" and declare myself a doctor. I can't just say "I decided that a new definition of child is anyone who wants to be called that" and declare myself a child, and therefore eligible to compete in children's sports. 

It doesn't matter what books the definitions of doctor and child appear in. It doesn't matter that the standards of getting a medical degree are different in different countries, or that some people use the word child to describe slightly different age ranges.>how is it cheating when the hormones they take actively make them weaker than cis men?

\#1, because they're still a man in the women's division. Just like how adults can't compete in the children's division, it wouldn't matter if the adults took pills to weaken themselves... the children's division simply isn't for them.

\#2, because the slightly weakened men still have a significant physical advantage over women. Several scientific studies have demonstrated this.

Real world results prove the same thing - men who were uncompetitive in the men's division and never won there, switch over to the women's league and immediately win a national championship or world championship. How much more obvious does it have to get that this is cheating?

>but it would be much more unfair for trans women to compete with/against cis men

Men taking estrogen chose to do that to themselves. If they don't like that it makes it harder for them to win at sports, it's their problem and they can solve it. Make another league for men pretending to be women or something.

But the solution is not "make it women's problem". The solution is not taking away women's rights to benefit men.

>only cited less than 30 wins in a decade

It's fucking cheating, dude. 30 championships have been stolen from women. How much cheating has to take place before people can object to it? If you ask me, any cheating at all should be put to a stop.

You didn't answer my question... if someone broke into your house to steal your property, is it OK if they only steal some of it? Is it only a problem if they steal everything?

>biological difference exist for all sports.

And the existence of these is not a justification to allow men to cheat against women. Why are you so desperate to justify allowing cheating?

>just look at Caster Semenya

He is a man, he was born with testes and has male testosterone levels. He cheated by competing in women's sports. He was offered the opportunity to be allowed to continue cheating by reducing his testosterone levels, he quit competing because he didn't want to race without a massive advantage.

>Semenya got her gold medal taken away from her. does this seem fair to you?

Of course! The fastest woman in the race got her gold medal that she rightly deserved. Well actually it's not completely fair... she should have received it at the actual event and been able to celebrate her victory on the day it happened. Caster still got to steal her victory and her gold medal for a little while.

>biological advantages are just a part of sports.

Yes, sports aren't perfectly fair. Not everyone has the exact same body, perfect fairness will never be possible.

But that is not a valid reason to stop caring about fairness entirely, and allow men into women's sports and adults into children's sports and just let anyone do whatever they want. We still have to try to maintain fairness where possible, and that means women get to have their own separate sports leagues.

>and you are more informed than the women who actually compete against and with trans women?

Yes. I am certainly more informed than anyone who has been convinced of the lie that men competing against women is a fair competition.

I expect that some of the men competing in women's sports aren't very athletic at all, so there are some women beating them and thinking "nothing unfair about that". But if they learned more about the issue, and especially if they lost a championship to a man, they would realize that men vs women in sports is completely unfair.

>just admit it isn't about fairness. 

It is though. I'm against cheating.

> it's about transphobia. 

Nope. Being against cheating and supporting equal rights for women isn't transphobia.

> a few girls in California sued to block trans women from competing against them. 

As they should. Good for them. Keep men out of women's sports.

>do you know what happened next? one of them beat the trans woman. 

So the man stole 2nd place, and knocked the third fastest woman off the podium. And if there's another level of competition beyond the state championship, he may have cost a woman a chance to advance to that. Terrible.

It shows your complete misunderstanding of sports and of this entire issue that you think the man stealing 2nd place is somehow proof that cheating is fine and not a problem at all. You think only 1st place matters, and that if a cheater didn't take 1st then there's no problem at all.

You're mistaken. Cheating is wrong no matter what place he finishes. We ban steroids in sports, nobody says "the guy on steroids only finished in second place so it's OK".

>the women who complain about competing against cis women don't care about fairness, they just want someone to blame when/if they lose.

Your position is just laughable. You think it's impossible that highly competitive athletes who have trained for countless hours over several years could possibly care about fairness or oppose cheating. You think those pesky women just want excuses for their failures. You think men should totally be allowed to cheat, but shame on women if they don't want to be cheated. Man cheats, women get the blame. What a joke.So you don’t care if a person is trans?No most is directed at children. And its harder on boys. Usually by the main care giver .Yeah, sure, I don't deny some of the people he's calling out are acting obnoxious.

I've noticed a more aggresive tone in his discourse and I don't understand why

I don't see the same tone on the way he expressed himself about the same issue lately

>What ideology? An ideology is (roughly): A set of ideas about the way the world should be organized socially/politically AND the methods to achieve that organization.

The ideology that one should get oneself up before trying to change the world? I thought that was what the 12 rules were about. He spoke about how should an individual would have to act for himself and the society he (the individual) was part of

How are the 12 rules not an ideology?

>Making a declaration about the category of gender or category of sex isn't necessarily ideological....its observation, not advocacy.

I don't understand how this things are different. The way of an idividual of living is political. It's a thing of living. How do you disagree?

>It is NOT ideological mostly because it eschews politics as you note. The ideas are targeted toward controlling the behavior of others or society at large. They are personal rules for personal thriving.

But you just said that an ideology is a set of ideas about the way the world should be organized "socially/politically"

What does it means to you for there to exist an "organization of social/politial" meaning if it's not about a way of life?

>Note that often this debate centers around one side prescribing specific actions or requirements (pronoun usage, admittance to restricted spaces etc) whereas the other side insists on the personal right to assent or decline to engage....or to "conserve" traditional organization (sex specific spaces, which are more of a human universal than a novel political proposal).

I see it as one side trying to accept individual liberties and one side trying to determine a way of living. Im gonna be always against someone forcing the other one to speak in a determined way of speech

Following this idea, no one should be force to refer to themselves in a way that was determined by a state or a higher power>I don't observe a change here.  From what I know his policy on use of pronouns has not changed.

He repeatedly and deliberately misgenders people on Twitter.I guess analysis of anything could be controversial if your analysis doesn't line up with general consensus, and troubling if you dig deep enough on any subjecthis trans sons transition. the court ruled he wasn’t able to stop him from transitioning, and he continued to try and stop the transition. he didn’t consult with any of the medical professionals involved in the transition, and instead decided to go to the media to complainsure, but to boil the case down to “man was jailed for misgendering” is incredibly reductive and dishonestDid you even click the link in my comments???It’s not true because I say it. It’s true because that’s what trans people experience whether you believe them or not. It’s. It just words it’s entire lives and that’s what you’re not getting. If you actually had empathy for others you’d realize what they are experiencing even if you don’t agree with it 

I’m not debating this with you

If you don’t wanna understand or believe them that’s on youYes, the majority of people are not intersex, but claiming that there are only two categories is false.

Trans people are also a rare variation of gender just like intersex people are a rare variation of sex.No, denying existence means you don’t think it’s real or valid.

You’re the only one here equating it with murder and you look foolish cause it shows you don’t understand the issue.

That is sex, which is different from gender.

>For as long as the words have existed, man meant adult human male and woman meant adult human female.

Word change meaning over time, for a long time "plane" meant one thing, now, it means something more than just that.

And i'm not saying that man and woman doesn't mean that anymore, just that we have more definitions for those words than just that.

>No one was ever confused about the meanings in the past.

Trans people have existed for as long as humans have.

>Back when women didn't have the right to vote, they didn't let women vote if they wore suits, they didn't let women vote if they pretend to be men. 

Yes, but they did let trans men vote, etc, there are many notable trans men who have done many accomplishments, one even served in the civil war.

For example Dr. Alan Hart or Albert Cashier.

>Somehow the adult human males were the ones drafted into the military. You know why? Because that's what the word "man" means. 

Albert Cashier was drafted into the war.

>I still don't know what kind of point you're trying to get it. Nitpicking definitions and talking about word origins is never going to change the fact that it isn't valid to make up new definitions to benefit yourself.

It doesn't benefit me, it is just more accurate, there are men who aren't adult human males and women who aren't adult human females. Thus having more than that definition is crucial for accuracy.

>I can't just say "I decided that a new definition of doctor is anyone who thinks medicine is interesting" and declare myself a doctor.

No because doctor is prescriptive, not descriptive, it is a job/role, not a social construct.

This is a great example, because usually one might assume a doctor to be someone who is a certified medical practitioner, but doctor can also mean someone with a doctorate.

> I can't just say "I decided that a new definition of child is anyone who wants to be called that" and declare myself a child

Age isn't a social construct either.

>It doesn't matter what books the definitions of doctor and child appear in. It doesn't matter that the standards of getting a medical degree are different in different countries, or that some people use the word child to describe slightly different age ranges.

It does...Not particularly. I’m even fine using their alternative pronouns. I’m not fine with transitioning kids, and I’m not fine with the “trans women are women” attitude. They aren’t women.Okay, I think I get what you are saying. His YouTube content doesn't bother you but his Twitter content does because it comes off as troll-like.And I'm still waiting for you to provide evidence for your claims. Are you perhaps struggling with proving those things because they're not fucking true? Lies, one might say?>Do you recall the interview I'm speaking about? The one he said that he would respect the pronouns of the person infront of him while the other person was being respectfull?

He's said that in dozen of interview over several years.  That's consistent to me.  

>I don't see the same tone on the way he expressed himself

That's very indefinite. I might agree but I don't think its a "change" but rather revealing more over time.   

>How are the 12 rules not an ideology?

They don't prescribe broad social organization, or a way to achieve it.  Full stop.  

>The way of an idividual of living is political. It's a thing of living.

Observing the sex of an organism has nothing to do with "policy".  Therefore it is not political.  It becomes political when declarations of truth (I am a male woman) are combined with advocacy for **new policy changes** (access to restricted spaces for example, or compelled speech).  

>What does it means to you for there to exist an "organization of social/politial" meaning if it's not about a way of life?

Prescribing or requiring OTHERS to act in a way agreeable to oneself is political.  The book 12 rules regards personal action but not social engineering.  

>Following this idea, no one should be force to refer to themselves in a way that was determined by a state or a higher power

That "force" is a hallmark of ideology...and exactly what Peterson rejects.  He thinks language and social interaction should not be coerced, but rather negotiated one small interaction at a time.He never made any promises about how he would refer to third parties on twitter. 

Interpersonally, Peterson has always said he would use pronouns appropriate to the presentation of the individual.It has to capture attention to be controversial.  That's basically the premise of the OP (Why do we care?).

The actual existence of trans people captures attention...as Peterson says, they are lightning rods for bigger questions about the reality and biology of human difference.his troubled, minor daughter’s stubborn determination to disfigure herself. 

And good for him! We wouldn’t know about this travesty of justice if he didn’t.The Canadian govt tried to compel the man’s speech concerning his own daughter. And jailed him when he didn’t cooperate. 

Seems an apt description to me.I appreciate their experience. I’m empathetic to their mental illness. Affirmation of delusion is not required for empathy.You’re literally just making shit up> No, denying existence means you don’t think it’s real or valid.

Lots of people equate this to murder.  I think its silly....and that's why I'm ridiculing YOUR side of the argument.> That is sex, which is different from gender.

Correct. I deal with physical reality, not pretend.

> Word change meaning over time

Not a valid argument. Sometimes words do organically change over time. That doesn't mean you can make up new definitions to benefit yourself and demand that everyone else use it. You can't force a change, especially in a situation like this where forcing a change harms people and takes away their rights.

> Trans people have existed for as long as humans have.

People pretending to be something they're not have always existed, but the word man always meant adult human male and woman always meant adult human female.

> Yes, but they did let trans men vote, etc

Not legally. Either a woman had a good disguise and fooled people, or someone broke the law and allowed the woman to cast a vote despite it being illegal.

> Albert Cashier was drafted into the war.

Wikipedia says she enlisted in 1862. She disguised herself and lied about her age and sex. She was later charged with fraud for being a woman who receives a military pension, but was eventually allowed to keep it.

She illegally voted, and got away with it because people believed she was a man. Had they known, she wouldn't have been allowed to vote, because women were banned from voting at the time.

> It doesn't benefit me

Maybe not you personally, but when trans people do it, it is directly for their benefit. They want to be allowed into women's sports and women's spaces despite not being a woman, so they make up a new definition that benefits them and demands that everyone else go along with it.

> it is just more accurate, 

No, it's less accurate because trans ideology has no definition for woman and man at all.

> there are men who aren't adult human males and women who aren't adult human females. 

No there aren't. Every man is male. Every woman is female. Any male claiming to be a woman is just pretending. Pretending doesn't make it real. Disguises don't make it real. It only counts if it's actually true and actually real.

It's absurd to claim that it's "more accurate" to reject the meanings of words. Can you define the word woman without using a circular non-definition?

Can you tell me the difference between a woman and a man? Trans activists can never answer these questions, because trans ideology is literal nonsense. It simply denies that words have definitions whenever doing so would benefit men who want to invade women's spaces.

> Age isn't a social construct either.

By your logic, it can be.

Trans ideology says that men can become women just by pretending to be. It says that physical reality doesn't matter, only claimed identity does.

So apply the same logic here. Why can't an adult become a child just by claiming to be? Why can't he say physical reality doesn't matter, only his claimed identity?

Apply your own rules consistently. Either reality matters, or pretend identities do.

Just as you think someone can be male but still have the identity of woman, someone can be 40 years old but claim the identity of child. Or someone can be white but claim the identity of black.

Which one do you go with? Actual reality, or claimed identity? Pick one, and be consistent with it in each situation.You are providing it right now. The point is that Jordan’s interpretation of C16 isn’t ridiculous because all the people who say “that’s not what C16 actually does” wouldn’t accept an amendment to it to prevent compelled speech. They won’t simply agree that compelled speech shouldn’t be part of the law. Lawyers who disagree with him won’t guarantee C16 can’t be used that way. I would have agreed that Jordan Peterson wasn’t really interested in compelled speech if the reaction to him had simply been “the law shouldn’t compel speech, Jordan, you are right, let’s add that to C16.” You are providing all the supporting evidence I need in this exchange.>Observing the sex of an organism has nothing to do with "policy".  Therefore it is not political.  It becomes political when declarations of truth (I am a male woman) are combined with advocacy for new policy changes

Is it political to deny people medical care? Is it political to refuse to allow people to update their legal names and birth certificates when we otherwise allow this for cis people?That is not a qualifier Peterson made. Misgendering is misgendering. It's time to drop the pretense, nobody is buying it anymore. Peterson has gone mask-off.I think calling them "lightning rods" is a little dehumanizing but sure. The existence of trans people does beg several questions about our assumptions around human interaction, and has done for a reasonable length of time might I add.as far as I know, his son is still transitioning. only thing he succeeded in was irreparably damaging his relationship with his childit was for contempt of court after the judge instructed him not to discuss the matter with the press during the court procedure.Well, [this was one](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8099405/) and [this was the other](https://whatweknow.inequality.cornell.edu/topics/lgbt-equality/what-does-the-scholarly-research-say-about-the-well-being-of-transgender-people/)It’s not mental illness. That’s just your opinionI don’t care if you think it’s silly. It’s notNo, I'm not. If a viewpoint is so absurd that it is not worthy of consideration then why amend a bill to acknowledge it? Let me put it this way: if tomorrow Congress debated a bill and I said that it permitted you to fuck dogs, should they amend it to explicitly ban you from fucking dogs? It's transparent bullshit.

This is something called a "kafkatrap" that reactionaries and fascists engage in all the time -- if you don't go out of your way to assure my imaginary fears then you're actually just as bad as my imaginary fears!

**If the bill did what you said it did then why haven't Peterson's critics filed a police report to arrest him?**

You also haven't provided evidence of the extremely dubious claims you made regarding Peterson's former employers (before he blithely fell in with some of the worst fascists imaginable at the Daily Wire, additional evidence that he was never acting in sincerity).> Misgendering is misgendering.

Discussing gender and using public figure third parties as examples is not the "misgendering" that Peterson ever referred to.  

You are basically saying it is inappropriate to discuss this publicly AT ALL, which is ridiculous.  

Misgendering in the sense of abuse requires a personal interaction (my opinon).....and its a fact that Peterson refers to interpersonal interactions when he talks about his own behavior as a teacher and a therapist.

>Peterson has gone mask-off.

Peterson never expressed belief that people could change their sex or gender without at least some social negotiation.  We are discussing whether Peterson has CHANGED.  There is no transition from "mask on" to "mask off".  He's been pretty consistent on this.  

Does he use preferred pronouns? Yes

Does he believe Page is a man?  No.> I think calling them "lightning rods" is a little dehumanizing but sure. 

It's not.  It's a term for people that is neutral.  It is often used to describe Peterson cooincidentally.I applaud him. 

He’s the only one who accepted his daughter as the precious, unique individual she was. Nobody else in her life cared enough about her to do that. 

She’ll likely thank him for that one day.I can’t help but wonder: what would’ve been the harm of putting a pause on her transition and maybe getting the poor girl some counseling; at least until she’s a legal adult? What’s the big hurry? Are you scared she’s going to change her mind before you have the chance to butcher her?He referred to her in the press using her biological pronouns and was found in contempt of court.I think your comment sent before it was completedNo its not.

Referring to Elliot Page as "Ellen" and "she" is misgendering. No amount of mental gymnastics is going to change that. Jordan is deliberately using a name and pronoun that Elliot does not use. 

That is because he is a hateful bigot. You know it. I know it. It's time to stop playing these games of pretend. If you want to join in on the bigotry then at least have the decency to be upfront about it.And often I think it's pretty dehumanizing in that context too.

Though in this context I think it's especially so because you're talking about trans people as if their very existence needs to be questioned. A lightning rod doesn't cause lightning, it attracts it. By calling them lightning rods for questions you're not saying "the trans debate has made me question the interactions between sex, gender, and the wider human interaction", rather you're saying "trans people should be questioned on their identity". Which, should they? We have plenty of resources that have already asked those questions of trans people.don’t worry, his mother accepted him as the precious individual he is.        

no, he likely won’t thank his father. he will likely thank his mother for being loving and supportive during his transition“Are you scared she’s going to change her mind before you have the chance to butcher her?” what an unhinged and strangely worded question. do you genuinely believe doctors are just chomping at the bits to be able to “butcher” children? rather than providing the treatment they believe is the best fit for the patient?            

if you’ve ever spoken to a trans person, you would know how irreversible the changes puberty causes are. most trans people would have loved to start their transition early as possiblethat was immediately after the judge ordered he doesn’t talk to the press about the treatment his son was receivingYeah because it’s not a mental illness.All I'm hearing is that you cannot provide an iota of evidence for any of your delusional beliefs. If, and only if, you can prove that speech is being or would be compelled would I even consider engaging in this fantastical line of inquiry. I simply will not give it the time of day until you can show that it is a real thing worth consideration. You are not owed this indulgence.> Referring to Elliot Page as "Ellen" and "she" is misgendering. 

She's not here though. 

>Jordan is deliberately using a name and pronoun that Elliot does not use.

I'll agree with that.  It is purposeful because its a discussion about truth.  Its not abuse.  

>If you want to join in on the bigotry then at least have the decency to be upfront about it.

I'm up front but not a bigot.  Bigotry is more in line with what you are doing....calling names to pressure others to adopt your beliefs.>And often I think it's pretty dehumanizing in that context too.

You haven't offered a reason after several exchanges so I'll just agree to disagree.  Other descriptors like "prodigy", "famous" or "iconic" are also morally neutral.

No I'm not.  

>trans people should be questioned on their identity"

Everyone should be as an aside (by therapists etc).  But I'm not saying that here. I'm not talking about question particular or specific "people" at all.  I'm talking about ideas and concepts.   

>We have plenty of resources that have already asked those questions of trans people.

I don't know what you are referring to.  If you think the question of what makes trans people trans (or cis cis) is settled....it isn't.  Scientifically or otherwise.  

> I think it's especially so because you're talking about trans people as if their very existence needs to be questioned.

I don't think I'm doing that.Her mother didn’t accept her, or do anything to help her accept herself. 

Her mother cooperated with the butchers who promised to mutilate and neuter her young body.

For this she will no doubt come to seething resentment of her mother and the doctors who lacked the common sense to intervene in a child’s misguided view of herself.We can’t be sure she’s not just in an adolescent tomboy phase. Neither can she, because she is a CHILD. So what’s the hurry? 

Is her “trans”-ness liable to wear off if her young body is permitted to traverse puberty? That doesn’t reflect well on “trans”-ness as the immutable condition you insist it is.

And the doctors are in it for the money. They’ll give you 36DDs and cloven hooves if that’s what you want.That judge can go piss up a rope. It’s no judge’s place to tell a dad he must stay quiet while a doctor is mutilating and neutering his daughter.Yes it is. Distress derived from your own biology is abnormal and impacts normal cognitive function. Wanting to harm your body in irreparable ways is a product of mental illness.>She's not here though.

"She" is not Elliot's gender. Ergo, misgendering. I'm sure you think it's cute and funny that you're being deliberately obtuse, but it's not.

Let's apply your special boy's special rule: be precise in your language. Elliot's pronouns are he/him. Using something other than that is deliberate imprecision of language to advance an ideological agenda.

You have been anything but up front. You are hiding behind *bullshit* to justify your hate.I'm just explaining that I think your use of "lightning rod" is perhaps not correct in this instance, along with my reason for thinking so. You're welcome to disagree. Just, maybe think through your metaphors more?his mother did accept him. acceptance shouldn’t be conditional on your child being how *you* want them to be. you should accept your child for who they want to be 

it’s really interesting how you choose to use such emotionally loaded words. “butchers” “mutilate” I see you follow Petersons words closely! he likely wouldn’t be getting too surgery until 18, and after that, it’s his body to do whatever he wants with[the detransition rate for trans youth is incredibly low.](https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/150/2/e2021056082/186992/Gender-Identity-5-Years-After-Social-Transition?autologincheck=redirected)

>Is her “trans”-ness liable to wear off if her young body is permitted to traverse puberty? That doesn’t reflect well on “trans”-ness as the immutable condition you seem to think it is.              

you're either being intentionally obtuse or your reading comprehension is very bad. no idea how you came to that conclusion after my comment.          

people transition after puberty, but most wish they would've transitioned before puberty due to the physical changes that occur during puberty.the judge ordered the father to stop "publishing information about AB’s gender identity, physical and mental health, medical status or treatments," which is completely reasonable. they were also attemping to protect the childs identity, but the father didnt obey this.              

put yourself in the childs shoes. you're going through a transition, which is hard enough, and you have your father going to the media to talk about how wrong and stupid you are, while repeatedly refusing to affirm your identity. the trauma the father is causing is much worse than whatever "mutilation" you're imagining.It’s only harming from your limited perspective. So is circumcision mental illness too? Is any surgery mental illness? Grow the fuck up.Ahh, the intellectual coward's last resort. Good to know that you're not just a bigot but that you're also very stupid.> "She" is not Elliot's gender. Ergo, misgendering. I'm sure you think it's cute and funny that you're being deliberately obtuse, but it's not.

It's an important distinction.  She's not here.  Whoever and whenever she is or isn't.  It's not abuse because this is a hypothetical discussion about an absent (or "past" if you prefer) public figure.  And we can agree that she was a she in the past....and that fact is important to the discussion

>You are hiding behind bullshit to justify your hate.

I don't hate.  We are talking about whether another third party (Peterson) has generally changed his beliefs or maintained them.  I think the former.  

You disagree with me so you immediately jump to "You're a bigot" and "you hate".  I haven't said or done anything bigoted in this conversation.  I'm not even explicitly disagreeing with you about gender ideology...just about the evolution of Peterson's belief.You're not explaining it though.  You just keep saying it.  What specifically is "dehumanizing" about it?

Its describing a phenomenon where controversial topics center around human individuals.  

To say something like "immigrants are lighting rods for discussions about human rights" is not dehumanizing.  If anything its tends toward the opposite. Same with "Thalidomide babies are a lightening rod for discussion of drug regulation and safety".  

Maybe if one tried they could use the term in a dehumanizing context...but I have not done so.  

>Just, maybe think through your metaphors more?

Maybe you should think about it more and figure out the root of your irrational aversion to the figure of speech...maybe you don't like lightning?No. You don’t accept children for who they WANT to be. They are children. What they WANT is often not good for them. As a parent, your job is to protect them; oftentimes from what they WANT. That’s what her dad was trying to do when they put him in jail for not participating in the neutering of his daughter. 

And no. Her mother didn’t accept her for who she was. And she didn’t help her daughter accept herself for who she was. Her mother abdicated her job as the girl’s parent and handed her over to the butchers.And most pre-adolescent girls who traverse a tomboy phase, either before puberty or after, are thankful that no one convinced them they were actually boys and encouraged them to neuter themselves. 

Seriously, how could she even know what it feels like to be a boy? She is a girl. She only knows what it is to be a girl. She has never NOT been a girl. She can only IMAGINE in her pre-adolescent mind what it MIGHT feel like to be a boy. That is absolutely no basis upon which she could possibly determine that she IS one. 

She needed a parent like her dad to advocate for her, show her how to accept and love herself for the girl she is.Again. The judge can go piss up a rope. 

His daughter was intent on harming herself. Her mother wouldn’t intervene. What choice did he have? 

He did what any father worth his salt would do.No its objectively harming. Its mutilation of perfectly healthy bodies (childrens bodies in some cases) for no medically relevant reason. Its self harm.  
Your whataboutist red herrings arent going to work here. Ive given you multiple reasons why transsexualism (formerly known as gender/body dysphoria) is a mental illness, and your only retort is "no its not."There is a distinction here, but not the one that you are making -- misgendering and abuse are different concepts that at times overlap. For example, if I accidentally mistake you for the other gender in public and address you as "ma'am" instead of "sir" or vice versa, I have misgendered you but I am not being abusive. If you correct me and I persist in deliberately misidentifying you, then it crosses into abuse. We accept this as true with cis people all the time: try repeatedly calling your cis boss the incorrect pronouns and let me know how it goes!

Abuse requires a deliberate pattern of misgendering, which is what Jordan is doing when he continues to refer to Elliot as Ellen. So he's both misgendering and abusive. That is because he is a hateful bigot. If you're not a hateful bigot, then why defend hateful bigotry?To repeat myself: Lightning rods don't generate lightning, they attract it. By calling trans people lightning rods for questions you're not saying "the trans debate has made me question the interactions between sex, gender, and the wider human interaction", rather you're saying "trans people should be questioned on their identity". The latter is literally "othering" trans people by stating their existence is right to question. That is dehumanizing.

It's incorrect use of the metaphor going by your intended meaning, and the inferred meaning *is dehumanizing*."protecting" him from who he wants to be is causing more harm than whatever conversion therapy you want him to attend. [just look at the negative mental health trends of trans youth with unsupportive parents](https://transpulseproject.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Impacts-of-Strong-Parental-Support-for-Trans-Youth-vFINAL.pdf). like fuck, you sound like those parents who would kick their kids out for being gay.               

his mother accepted him much more than his father ever did. his father only accepts him if he acts like the daughter he wants him to be. his acceptance of him is completely conditionalI assume you’re like the father and have put in no effort in understanding gender dysphoria, I really recommend you do some reading if you’re genuinely asking me how someone can experience it lmfaooo.         

we aren’t going to agree on this, so I’m done with this conversation. again, though, I really fucking hope you never have a trans kidand now his son will hate him forever. so good for him I guess?> misgendering and abuse are different concepts that at times overlap

OK.  As the discussion centers on Peterson, I am referring to the interpersonal situations that he has described and commented upon directly.  

>Abuse requires a deliberate pattern of misgendering, which is what Jordan is doing when he continues to refer to Elliot as Ellen.

Disagree.  The intention is to have a discussion about truth.  What you are doing is defining the discussion of a taboo topic as abuse for chilling effect.  It's not that hard to see.  

Whether Page is a man or a woman is a controversial subject.  This is not at all settled socially or scientifically and discussion of this should not be regarded automatically as personal abuse of Page.  

Socially, Peterson (and myself I suppose) seem to have a rule of automatically complying with an individual's gender presentation.  But when it comes to discussions about truth, automatic compliance is not on offer....and its frankly ridiculous to insist upon it or equate discussion with abuse.> Lightning rods don't generate lightning, they attract it. 

Irrelevant to the dehumanization issue.  You are assigning a meaning to "lightning" that is analogous to some kind of personal abuse.  Discussion of these concepts is NOT abuse and does not involve subjecting any trans people to anything unwanted.   

**The metaphor doesn't indicate we literally discuss where trans people are physically standing.**  That's a silly reading.       

>rather you're saying "trans people should be questioned on their identity".

No I'm not.  Nothing about the metaphor indicates that trans PEOPLE should be personally questioned about this.  

>The latter is literally "othering" trans people by stating their existence is right to question.

Nothing about "existence" is in question here.  You are injecting that inappropriately into the discussion.  

>It's incorrect use of the metaphor going by your intended meaning, and the inferred meaning is dehumanizing.

You are inferring wrong.Wouldn’t you agree that pre-adolescent girls with mental health issues are in no position to make these sorts of determinations for themselves and their young bodies? The consequences of which they can’t even begin to fathom? And for her mother to simply go along with what her daughter WANTS I.e. to permanently disfigure herself is unconscionable. She’s a child with, as you indicated, mental health issues. 

She needed a parent like her dad. To show her how to love and accept herself AS SHE WAS. and NOT how her pre-adolescent mind w/ mental health issues WANTS.For the people that legitimately suffer from it, I understand it as a mental illness akin to BIID (where people with healthy limbs identify as amputees) and anorexia (where emaciated people identify as obese).

It is not “care” to amputate the BIID sufferer’s healthy limbs. Nor is it “care” to prescribe diet pills to the anorexia sufferer.

Then there are the narcissists and the attention-seekers line yourself, for whom it is merely the vehicle through which you pursue your attention-seeking, and your narcissism.His daughter will regret what she did to herself. And resent her mother for letting her do it.>As the discussion centers on Peterson, I am referring to the interpersonal situations that he has described and commented upon directly.

He said that if asked by a person, he would use their preferred pronouns. Am I to believe that he persists in misgendering Elliot Page solely because Elliot hasn't directly asked him to stop being a prick?

>Disagree.  The intention is to have a discussion about truth.  What you are doing is defining the discussion of a taboo topic as abuse for chilling effect.  It's not that hard to see.

If you sincerely believe this then repeatedly refer to your boss with incorrect pronouns and let me know how it goes! Just explain that you're discussing truth and don't believe such a thing is taboo.Why call them lightning rods for questions if the questions aren't the lightning? This is why I'm saying it's bad use of metaphordo you know if he has a history of mental health issues besides gender dysphoria? or are you just speculating? he didn’t make the decision alone. he didn’t just wake up one day, walk to the doctors, and requested hormones. he had been socially transitioning for 4 years and got approved to start hormones by his mother, psychologists, and doctors.         

I pray to god you never have a trans child, because they will despise you> Am I to believe that he persists in misgendering Elliot Page solely because Elliot hasn't directly asked him to stop being a prick?

They haven't met as far as I know...so that's all "not applicable".   

>If you sincerely believe this then repeatedly refer to your boss with incorrect pronouns and let me know how it goes!

The if/then doesn't make sense to me.  My bosses gender is not the subject of the conversation.  And Page isn't Peterson's boss??  Not sure of the analogy you're going for.  

>Just explain that you're discussing truth and don't believe such a thing is taboo.

Discussing taboo things isn't abuse.  Everyone agrees that interpersonal misgendering is some kind of taboo.  But is discussing a taboo a taboo?  You keep conflating the interpersonal with the third-party discussions (edit, sorry - discussions ABOUT third parties).

If you want to make a stronger argument, I would go with "If Peterson wants to publicly discuss the truth of gender, involving real-person examples is not necessary and only rude and hurtful".> Why call them lightning rods for questions if the questions aren't the lightning? 

It's a **metaphor** for very broad issues (electric charge) that crystalize into public consciousness with discussion (lightening) precipitated around very narrow phenomenon (the "rod").

Its just like discussion of thalidomide don't question the "existence" of thalidomide babies, nor does discussion of immigration question the "existence" of immigrants.  

These discussion may be humanizing or dehumanizing in their content...but the initial metaphor is neither.  No more so than calling St Peter a "rock" is dehumanizing.Why is misgendering "not applicable" if it's not face-to-face?Okay but by calling trans people the "narrow phenomenon" instead of you know, people, and also implying their existence is **designed** to draw these attentions, you see how the metaphor isn't great right? I'm not arguing abuse or trans rights or anything right now. I just think you suck at using metaphor. I think you haven't thought it through.> "narrow phenomenon" instead of you know, people

Its not "instead of".  People are a phenomenon.  Transsexuality is a phenomenon. Existence is a phenomenon. 
 That's another word that's not a judgment.  In the sports world, it's even a sort of compliment ("phenom").

> implying their existence is **designed** to draw these attentions

I didn't imply that it's designed.  Transexuality just IS objectively attention catching.  Obviously.  

> I just think you suck at using metaphor. I think you haven't thought it through.

Well, all your reasons so far are nonsensical.  I've clarified that what I mean is not offensive in any way.  You continuing to put words in my mouth is not productive.I'm not saying you're offensive. I'm saying your metaphor is bad. A lightning rod is something **designed to attract lightning**, hence why I mention design. You aren't considering how people can read your metaphor, hence why it is bad metaphor.> A lightning rod is something designed to attract lightning, hence why I mention design

The fact that lightning rods are designed objects isn't a relevant part of the metaphor.    

They are also made of metal....I'm not saying trans people are metallic.  They are also long and narrow....not saying anything about the shape of trans people either.  They also sit on top of houses etc....

>You aren't considering how people can read your metaphor,

I am considering how a reasonable person would read it.  You are not being reasonable.  You are basically saying any metaphor containing a non-human "vehicle" is dehumanizing ("pillar of the community").  And any metaphor involving designed objects implies that people are designed (wtf?).  I don't accept that....I think basically nobody does...I don't think it would even occur to most people.hasn't the trans stuff gone a bit far? Background: I am a Catholic, conservative, transgender, and gay.

 It seems like before the pandemic, the transgender debate had a clear consensus: medical interventions should wait until the person reaches 18, and a few years on hormones should be required before participating in sports, for example. 

These were considered common-sense measures based on recognizing that transgender people exist and the need to establish social rules.

Jordan Peterson played a significant role in shaping this conversation, and I agreed with him at the time that the government shouldn't be involved in establishing these rules. 

However, it appears that the right wing as a whole is now leaning towards the extreme end of the horse shoe. 

like people calling cis a "slur" how is it any different from leftists in 2016 claiming that eating Chinese food is racist?

Both instances involve arguing about the "real meaning" of words. 

when discussing what defines a woman, Jordan Peterson astutely pointed out that we perceive the world through utility. 

Just as a chair is something to sit on, a woman is whatever serves that social situation best

This seems self-evident to me, and I am disappointed to see the right engaging in moral grandstanding and fear-mongering. It is disheartening to witness even Jordan Peterson falling into this trap.

In my view, all adults deserve to live their lives as they see fit. If your response to that is, "Well, I don't have to cater to their delusions," I would ask where else you apply this logic. For instance, if a Muslim man asked you to prepare his meal separately because his religion prohibits him from consuming pork, would you mix it anyway? Even if you disagree with someone, there is no reason to intentionally make them uncomfortable unless it stems from malice.

I struggle to understand where this malice comes from. Feminists have been advocating for laws and pushing a particular narrative for years, and yet I don't harbor hatred towards women or even reject the idea that women deserve respect. Therefore, I find it difficult to comprehend why one would hate a group of people simply because you disagree with how they choose to live their lives.

&#x200B;In short, the left pushed too far (more on this in a moment) and it caused a backlash of people pushing too far in the other direction.  When gender dysphoria was simply considered an affliction that some people had, there really wasn't a huge backlash.  I still have sympathy for people that truly do struggle with gender dysphoria and strongly believe that reasonable accommodations should be made to support their mental health.  It's analogous to reasonable accommodations like installing ramps in businesses for those that need it.  I think that things like using the bathroom for the sex that you identify with is a reasonable accommodation like this.

What happened is the far left changed the manner in which they think of transgender people.  They threw out the general notion that trans people have an issue that may need these accommodations and general tolerance in order to assist in keeping them mentally healthy.  Instead, they turned transgender people into something symbolic and emblematic of their general philosophy that all societal norms should be torn down.  Instead of desiring tolerance, they started demanding celebration.  This is led to a giant uptick in teenagers with completely normal emotional issues and a common desire to be part of a countercultural movement to begin to call themselves transgender as a way to express themselves much like many teenagers have done in the past with things like being emo or gothic.  Conflating real trans people with these modern teenagers is much of the reason for the backlash in the other direction that is going too far.

Reasonable accommodation and tolerance for those that do not neatly fit into the human binary sex category system is completely different from the attempt to destroy the category system altogether.  The right is swinging the other way by pushing for strong and rigid adherence to the binary sex category system.  They do this because they see it as the best way to protect the category system from destruction.  I just wish the left had not switched to aiming at the destruction of the category system, causing this backlash in the other direction.No one cares what you do until everything needs to be redefined because of trans.

That’s why everyone is fine with homosexuals.Defining a woman as an adult human female is extreme?Yes.. “republicans pounce”.. it is never the lefts fault for moving too far left, it is always the rights fault for calling it out.

The left inventing new words and expecting everybody to use those words (in some cases, legally or fear of losing your job) and then calling the right extremists is not going too far and is crummy leftist rhetoric that you read in the far left bowels of /r/politicsThe number of these posts questioning why this sub questions the trans worldview is pretty funny. 

For everyone in the back, most people do not hate trans people. But a lot of people do disagree with the conclusions of the trans worldview. 

It's a pretty easy distinction to make. 

And the blow back against it hasn't gone too far as long as that worldview threatens freedom of expression and speech.It was a long time coming in my opinion. The vitriol and resentment that the farther left has worked with from the start was bound to get a escalating reaction from the opposing side at some point. They've repeatedly, and often unfairly expressed their disdain for Peterson and the like and long term that's gonna cause us to lose composure and come up with takes like "CIS is a slur".

Regarding that take I personally wouldnt consider it a slur, but then you have to ask what makes something a slur? In the past it was "regular" words that were said hatefully that ended up becoming sore spots for the people they described. Eventually those people didn't want to be reffered to that way and labeled the name as an offense. In reality however the word wasnt to blame but the people using it the way they spat it out that caused the reaction.

Besides that the war continues to rage on. The idea that trans should wait till adulthood to transition has gone out the window seeing as a number of teenagers are coming out against doctors who've given them double mastectomies despite the fact that they werent actually trans in the first place. Jordan actually interved one such person you can watch that on YouTube. It's becoming a blood bath as the left continues to operate as deplorably as it has.I was going to give a detailed response.  Instead, I'll just say LoL to the obvious troll bait.

You are off base with every point, my friend.  Carefully disguised justifications for endorsing mental illness wrapped up in the illusion of virtue.So, the big change is the social declarations based on dubious claims. 

The old consensus was that people should be psychiatrically evaluated before being given any form of therapy. That’s gone out the window, and now kids are being given hormone therapy (with potentially dangerous side effects) with almost no consultation. Parents are losing custody for denying treatment. We’re not going to support harming children.

When it comes to sports, no amount of hormone therapy will be enough. You’d literally need to shave off bone and surgically remove muscle to make it fair. We’re not going to support cheating women out of their hard work and dedication. 

What makes a woman is not a social situation. Using a bed as a chair doesn’t make it so. Utility doesn’t define; composition does. This is something the LGBTQ mafia heavily denies, and instead espouses the ideological position that people can decide upon involuntary characteristics. A brunette can dye their hair, but that won’t make them blonde. Michael Jackson can bleach his skin, but he was still African American. And a person can declare their gender to be “attack helicopter”, but that doesn’t mean they can fly.

Now, for your example of equal treatment; if a Muslim man *asked* for no pork, I wouldn’t give him pork. Your analogy falls flat for two reasons; 

First, the Muslim man *asked.* The LGBTQ mafia don’t ask for anything; they bully, threaten, harass, intimidate, and often resort to violent acts.

Second, the Muslim man didn’t order me to submit to Allah, or burn a Bible. He hasn’t given me any instruction to behave in a manner which one could reasonably expect to make a person uncomfortable. He has *asked* me to comply with his wishes, *not* give orders to behave as though his worldview is correct, and *not* give orders to denounce my own religion in his presence.

The LGBTQ mafia espouses their ideology as correct, and everything contrary as literally causing child suicide. Comply or people die, a form of social terrorism, fear mongering, hate mongering, science denial. We won’t support denial of science, or social terrorism.

Cis as a slur? What we’ve got now is a majority of people being required to call themselves “cis” instead of “normal”, so we don’t offend people who aren’t “cis”. It’s a form of socially forced compliance with an ideology; compelled speech. I could imagine more of a backlash if everyone were socially required to say grace at every meal. They’d be protests and riots. There’s no real difference between the two examples, yet one is seen as progressive, and one as regressive. 

And as we now have to comply with the Rainbow Flag Regime, wearing ideological terminology and declaring our preferred pronouns (that just happen to be exactly what you expected 99.9% of the time making the endeavour redundant) or risk mob, sorry, *”social”* justice that threatens our ability to feed our families. 

As for hate? Well, that’s just more LGBTQ mafia propaganda. Any criticism of the ideology is levelled as hate. Jokes and humour are levelled as hate. Non-compliance with the Rainbow Flag Regime is levelled as hate. 
Hate used to mean an intense hostility and aversion, now it means “someone made a joke. Someone didn’t do what I wanted them to do.” 
Disagreement and hate are not synonymous, and it’s disingenuous to pretend they are.

So why do we reject it all? Why don’t we let trans people live how they want to live? 
The simplest answer is; The ideology used to justify living the way they want to live infringes upon our ability to live as we want to live, and harms society. 

Science denial, science by popular belief, infringing upon women’s only spaces, pushing ideology onto vulnerable kids, pushing unnecessary medications onto vulnerable kids, compelled speech, celebrating tokenism, and the ability to exploit the new status quo. All these things are harming society, harming more people than they help. 

If the LGBTQ mafia would stop attempting to manipulate scientific reason, stop threatening people, stop trying to force their ideology onto society like a 5th century Christian, stop trying to silence and demonise dissenters, stop celebrating tokenism, then I’m sure most people here would be happy to support the movement. 

They’re on the side that’s against free speech, literally trying to censor dissenters. If that’s not a massive red flag, I don’t know what is. 

If the LGBTQ mafia was willing to pull back, slow down, admit their solutions to the situation aren’t working, that they’re harmful, and decide to *work with the rest of society to fix them* then I’m sure most people here would be willing to help.I agree with the other commentator that trans-activism has gone too far. What we see as a response from the rest, is a counter-response.

I agree with you insofar that it’d be healthier if Trans were addressed by their pronouns etc. But it was inevitable.

I do have a distaste for the term „cis“ myself. You can just substitute that term with „normal“ (by all means of the definition)I hear what you're saying. I don't think there was ever a consensus that trans women in particular should be able to compete in women's sports after a couple years on hormones though. The average person always thought that was insane.>like people calling cis a "slur" how is it any different from leftists in 2016 claiming that eating Chinese food is racist?

Well, 'cis' is an artificial word for "Normalos" while China is a real place and "Chinese" is describing cultural features around there.

>where this malice comes from

The malice comes from people in general not accepting schools and other government agencies to interfere with their parental rights on deciding what medical and other treatments their kids can have, because they are the legal guardians. They don't like schools affirming confused and often autistic children of some artificial genders without telling the parent, or let some people prescribe them puberty blockers. They also take it offensive if laws are put in place that punishes parents for objecting such affirmative treatments, here in New Zealand up to 5 years prison for conversion therapy, which is as loosely defined as trying to talk your kid out of it. But teachers, psychologists and social workers trying to talk your kid to converse into some biological wreck because these puberty blockers mess up more than just puberty and such change surgery destroys their capability to have offspring, that is somehow not a conversion therapy. And then of course we do not like strangers talk with our kids about sexual practices from kindergarten age onwards. There is a time for some things and it is not kindergarten. And even at secondary school they do not necessarily need to know every kink out there graphically described. We also don't like very much that trans women and such who pretend to be trans women to invade women only space where they steal sport trophies from them and become dangerous to them in prisons or saunas. Like it or not, the number of trans women involved in violence against women is statistically significant.

And then you look into where the money comes from. This is business interest and lobby behind all of this. Someone figured out that you can make a lot of money with mutilating surgery (completely breaking the Hippocratic oath btw) and make those people life long depending on medicine, often in chronic pain. And there is very likely a connection with eugenics supporters, with the argument that such confused people should not have offspring, the world has too many people anyways.

Leave our kids alone and things will calm down.It's like a pitcher plant. Once society goes over the lip, it's going to end up in the bottom. Romans 1 and 2. Meanwhile, the "conservatives" think they are going to defend Gods morality with spite instead of love...My question to you would be do you believe trans women are women?  

Years ago the argument was always “we just want to live our lives and be left alone”.  If that was still the case today there would be no problem.  Adults who wanted to live their lives as the opposite gender could and were doing so.  That was till the narcissistic virtue signaling activists hijacked the movement.  Then it went from “we just want to live our lives” to “if you don’t participate you’ll be canceled”.  Well people have a breaking point and the activists pushed past that point and this is the result.>whatever serves that social situation best

And this is the fundamental issue. Trans rights activists call for “man”/“woman” to be redefined as a gender, when you already have “masculine” and “feminine”. A person can become more feminine. A person cannot become a female. You may call a calculator a “computer”, and it indeed performs computations, but it is nothing like a human who also performs computations, or a mac/windows/etc. device. So rather than using “computer” to refer to both “calculator” and “macbook”, we use “calculator” and “computer”.

>if a muslim man

A muslim man is not telling me i should not eat pork, or otherwise harassing me for consuming pork. A trans person is telling me i should call them something they are not, and some of the worst ones will harass you for not affirming their views"Chinese food" is the same as "cis". 

Okie doke."I am a Catholic, conservative, transgender, and gay."

&#x200B;

You must really, really, hate yourself. Assuming you're not just totally lying and trolling all of us. I really don't know. Your post while thoughtful, is extremely confusing. I almost believe you simply started with this headline so you could get people here to actually read your words (it works, I'm sure), and that you're lying to us.>For instance, if a Muslim man asked you to prepare his meal separately because his religion prohibits him from consuming pork, would you mix it anyway? 

*You* is not one of my pronouns, bigot.It’s all about perverse scienceGay and now transgender rights gets used to distract people from class, economic inequality and capitalism gone too far .That consensus was really a kind of coerced consensus that the left is known for these days - “accept what we say or be given the shameful label of “transphobe.”” Moreover, opposing views are instantly dismissed on the grounds that they are “transphobic.” 

I think the right is now doing something smart and using woke tactics against the woke movement. The recent boycotts are an example. The “cis is a slur” mirrors the victim mentality and fragile sensitivity of the left. It’s fighting fire with fire. “If you can be whiny victims to us then we can be whiny victims back at you.” 

The problem with the trans movement is making delusions socially acceptable, I.e. “I am what I think I am because I feel a certain way.” This same logic could be used to be trans-race, trans-age, or trans-species even. It’s absurd. It places emotions over rationality and order. Gay marriage made sense. Dudes with hairy nutsacks calling themselves women does not make sense. 

It’s similar to not supporting flat Earthers. I don’t support flat Earth because it’s nonsense. I’m not going to avoid referencing round Earth out of fear of hurting a flat Earther’s feelings. We shouldn’t be inclusive when inclusivity requires throwing away rationality in exchange for sensitivity. 

Regarding the Muslim example, it depends on how big a pain in the ass it is to cook his food. Also, cooking food is cooking food. I’m cooking beef away from all the pork. Big deal. Calling a trans person the “right things” means I’m acknowledging something I don’t believe to be true. It forces us to be disingenuous. Speaking is far more personal than cooking. I wouldn’t say that Allah is God to appease the Muslim man.Why are Muslim men asking me to make dinner for them? In what world are we all becoming in home personal chefs for Muslim families? And they do have some great food, I’ve been to a few restaurants serving food from various areas of the Muslim world. So while I have used the preferred pronouns of people I’m close to, I’m not hustling to the kitchen with a halal cookbook anytime soon.Control over how people are treated and what is allowed is very important. It’s the basis of society, in factCombating the extremism with extremism, and so on again. That’s been the game of the political right and left (+ media) for the last couple years.This is probably the fairest point I’ve seen made by anyone on the trans discussion. Not everyone will agree, but you’ve made your points respectfully and I think closely reflects how people feel.I completely agree. My only concern is that I feel the right has pushed too far in the opposite direction. I acknowledge that the left may have played a role in stirring up emotions, but I had hoped we could find a middle ground and strike a balance.The GOP is absolutely not fine with homosexuals.Gay people were also accused of redefining marriage, many people aren't fine with gay people.No, banning drag performances and violently threatening people considering to promote "gender ideology" is though.

Oh and so is saying that doctors should be hung for crimes against humanity.Defining 'woman' only as 'adult human female' and rejecting everyone who doesn't fit into the definition as not women is extreme.  
It is simply incorrect in its assumption about language. When someone says, "this girl can has 2000 miles on her," they don't mean to say the car has XX chromosomes. But it's also not incorrect in language; it's a tool to get a point across.This is the problem I'm talking about: being transgender is a real experience that people go through, and you can't divorce that from politics. I said the government shouldn't be allowed to enforce social etiquette, but that doesn't negate the fact that etiquette should exist, acknowledging that:" some people have a different experience than me, and that's okay."  
  
Why does this idea bring such a negative reaction? What harms you to simply be civil in disagreement?The rhetoric from the right when it comes to trans people has been escalating since 2016. Remember how they reacted to Bud Light hiring a trans person who transitioned as an adult for an advertisement?I've seen her and have followed a lot of detransitioners, but I would hope that deep down, we all strive to do the right thing, even if it's challenging. 

It would be simpler to say, "Let's eliminate transgenderism entirely," but the correct approach would be to be specific in the changes we want. 

it becomes even more difficult to bring about change when the right seems unreasonable. For instance, repeatedly referring to a trans woman as "he" goes against any person who possesses even a hint of sympathy or understanding of the transgender experience. Why would anyone with such empathy lend an ear to that person's opinions?  
Normalizing something that's already here? It's a real thing that people are experiencing, and we don't know what the best treatment is for it. But you want that decision to be out of the hands of a consenting adult?>The old consensus was that people should be psychiatrically evaluated before being given any form of therapy. That’s gone out the window, and now kids are being given hormone therapy (with potentially dangerous side effects) with almost no consultation.

Do you have a source for this?

>When it comes to sports, no amount of hormone therapy will be enough. You’d literally need to shave off bone and surgically remove muscle to make it fair. We’re not going to support cheating women out of their hard work and dedication.

Muscle mass does decrease with HRT, the extent depends from person to person, and what would be an acceptable bone structure for someone to compete? If a cis woman has that bone structure, would they be disallowed as well?

>A brunette can dye their hair, but that won’t make them blonde.

But they do have blonde hair then, and if you have to describe that person, it wouldn't make sense to call them a brunette.

>Michael Jackson can bleach his skin, but he was still African American.

He didn't claim to not be african american, and african americans can and do look "white", for example Logic the rapper.

>And a person can declare their gender to be “attack helicopter”, but that doesn’t mean they can fly.

Strawman.

>The LGBTQ mafia don’t ask for anything; they bully, threaten, harass, intimidate, and often resort to violent acts.

the fact that you call it a mafia, says a lot. LGBT people are people and just like if you get the name of someone wrong, they would correct you, LGBT people (most of them) would do the same.

>He has asked me to comply with his wishes, not give orders to behave as though his worldview is correct, and not give orders to denounce my own religion in his presence.

Trans people aren't ordering you either, you don't need to denounce anything to just call someone by pronouns that they wish.

>Cis as a slur? What we’ve got now is a majority of people being required to call themselves “cis” instead of “normal”, so we don’t offend people who aren’t “cis”. It’s a form of socially forced compliance with an ideology; compelled speech. I could imagine more of a backlash if everyone were socially required to say grace at every meal. They’d be protests and riots. There’s no real difference between the two examples, yet one is seen as progressive, and one as regressive.

Cis and trans are both used only when it is relevant, when you go to a christian's home, you can't be offended when they say grace.

>Science denial, science by popular belief

Do you have one scientific source that goes against trans people's claims?I am female, I don't identify with being female. Therefore cis does not apply to me.

Also, I refuse to be a subset of my own sex and have transwomen elevated into place above me (which they always are in these discussions)

Trans activism has gone far too far and this is the inevitable backlash. And not just from the right, but from lefty leaning people like me that are a bit older, have perspective and are looking on with utter confusion as to how this has been normalised.

Back in the 60s and 70s you had gender non-conforming people (not claiming to be the opposite sex) and you had the old school transexuals, who were mostly autogynophiles. 

FTM hardly existed because us women could be gender non-conforming AND NO ONE CARED.> I don't think there was ever a consensus that trans women in particular should be able to compete in women's sports after a couple years on hormones though. The average person always thought that was insane.

The olympics did allow trans people from 2003 after a year of HRT, its only a problem now?In a social sense? yes. in a biological sense? no.  
activists have contributed to the polarization of certain issues. It would help though if individuals on the right could distinguish between activists and those who are simply trying to live their livesGender and sex are indeed distinct concepts. We often assign gendered pronouns to inanimate objects, like referring to a boat as "she" or a Roomba as "he," showcasing how language itself recognizes this separation. While it may be easy to claim that you perceive women based solely on their biology, everyday language usage demonstrates a more nuanced understanding. Transgender individuals do not identify as their biological sex, which is why many pursue surgeries, hormone therapies, and other interventions. I am aware that I am not a biological man, but my aspiration is to align with society's social construct of what it means to be a man.  
  
The Muslim argument serves as an example of making accommodations for others despite personal disagreements or beliefs. We often accommodate religious and cultural differences, yet it seems that requesting a change in how one refers to a transgender person is viewed as crossing a boundary. It feels as though the difference lies in certain ideologies demanding an unwavering stance against granting any concessions to individuals like myself, regardless of whether it makes sense or not. It can create a perception that no compromise is possible  


If we approach our differences with an attitude of impossibility, it becomes challenging to make any progress or improvements.  
That is an example of taking a mundane issue and amplifying it to create a sense of moral outrage.I know that God loves the meek and the broken, and that socialism doesn't work. These beliefs are independent of my identity.  
If you hold reservations about children transitioning, it's important to note that the majority of the transgender community shares your concern. However, it is crucial to avoid generalizations and portrayals that paint all transgender individuals as a unified force targeting children, as this not only perpetuates misconceptions but also undermines the cause itself. It becomes challenging for any rational transgender person to support your perspective when they are depicted as monsters. It's similar to how one's disagreement with certain aspects of feminism should not cloud their perception of women as unique individuals, distinct from political ideologies. Your political views on transgender people should not overshadow your genuine feelings and understanding of us as individuals.I agree, the right is definitely pushing too far by not allowing any flexibility in the category system.  Honestly, I don't see an easy way out.  One possible way is for the non-far left to push back against their radicals.  I think if the non-far left acknowledged that there are two genders, but we should be flexible enough and tolerant enough to allow people who don't neatly fit into it to live their lives, it would help a lot.  I wish the right hadn't made the move they did, but It is the left's turn to move and I think that's the best one.What do you mean when you say the right has done to push too far back? The attitude that lead to boycotting Budweiser? Banning trans children’s books?Their definition doesn’t HAVE to mean ours are wrong. It’s a modification rather than a re-definition.

Also many doesn’t mean much when MOST people are fine with them.And yet they don’t throw the word woman around like that or try to say their car is a woman and thus should go to a doctor that treats females rather than a mechanic. Your example didn’t really make a strong point.stop using the leftist rhetoric and you won’t be attacked. The right isn’t denying that transgender people exist. You bring up the cis word. That refers to like simply straight people. It has nothing to do with a transgender person. You want to redefine words with threat of people losing their jobs and you then say “why can’t you be civil” 

It’s the highest form of gaslightingNothing personally bothers me about a person having an experience in front of me, in their home, on the street, in a city or town somewhere else. What bothers me is the associated insistence of acceptance and normalization (it’s not normal), the institutional capture of psychologists and surgeons in providing inappropriate procedures and guidance for minors (‘affirming’ care as a rule is wrong and hurts more confused children than it helps), the insistence of categorical breakdown without a stable/sane alternatives (“only a woman knows what a woman is”, there are more than 2 genders, biological sex is not a fact, etc). 

My problem is not and has never been with a trans person or people - it’s with those speaking FOR trans people pushing their own misguided/malevolent agendas and malarkey in this psychotic miasma and people failing to adequately combat them for fear of being pilloried.from what I've seen, a whole lot of people seem to pretty much just categorically reject that it \*is\* a real experience.  

which is just crazy to me, but well, I think this has shown a lot of people experience the world in a way that is ....

well, it seems like a whole lot of people experience the world in a way where they \*are\* their body.  they are a body that has consciousness.   and from that perspective,  it is at least internally sensible to view the trans concept as a rejection of reality.   "you" can't be something other than your body if what you are, is defined by your body.   ..... that only makes sense if "you" is something that is NOT defined by the body.Can anyone really know the experience of another,even a different gender. If you are trans as you say then can you understand a "cis" experience? Can I as a male really understand the female experience? How could society even allow that? We grow up as boys and girls. We are treated differently. I can never understand the experience of a woman dealing with having a period or getting pregnant,or God forbid having a child. I can never understand what it would be like to be a woman walking thru a dark alley or going to a bar where I would be hit on. 
Can you understand my experience as a man? Being a father? No and I wouldn't expect you too. I don't demand you to understand or have empathy for my experience. I don't even ask. 
I can't even comprehend what it would feel like to not feel like me. To feel I am in the wrong body. This isn't to say it is wrong,but I just have no comprehension of how that would feel. I don't hate my body,not saying you do,and I certainly don't feel I'm in the wrong body. I am what I am. 
I can have empathy that a person is struggling internally,no matter the issue. We all do. We may all struggle with who we are,or at least at times in our life. 
Do the extremes on both sides demand we understand the others experiences? That may be an issue and will cause a lot of blow back.“And we don’t know what the best treatment is for it”.  Exactly, so why are we experimenting with children?  If you really wanted to help children you would start with therapy.This is not an appropriate thing to have any kind of discussion on on this website. The admins are VERY clear that they do NOT want anything that can be considered transphobic to be passed around here. If you want to have this conversation you will have to find a different place to do it.Psycopaths are already here as well. Who knows. Maybe we don't know the right treatment there either. Maybe we should try affirming them in their perception of themselves.I agree. I am a male in biology and science,but I don't identify as one. I am me. I don't understand this concept of needing to identify. Being a male doesn't make me better or less than anyone or thing else.It became a problem after there were some trans athletes who were beating biological women by long shots and it came to the public's attention. That's been happening more so obviously the public backlash grew.A trans woman is defined as a man who lives his life as a woman.  Not woman but living socially as one. Okay that’s great as long as everyone can agree on that then we can move foreword.

Those on the right would gladly distinguish between activist and those who just want to live their lives…. But the left has to do that too.  They don’t.  The left mostly agrees with and pushes that ideology then labels anyone who questions it as ‘ists or ‘phobes.  You’re not allowed to disagree.  

IMO the activists do more harm than good.  They don’t bring about change, they escalate to extreme measures when civil debate fails, which causes nothing but more division.  More often than not they end up hurting the community they’re claiming to help….>transgender individuals do not identify as their biological sex

Which is why many here refer to it as a delusion, mental illness, etc. etc

>society’s social construct 

A person can be masculine without being a man. Which is where the issue arises. The trans movement keeps insisting that gender and sex are separate concepts, but then conflating them in the same breath. You do not need to have breasts to be feminine. You do not need to have testicles to be masculine. The most generous view of the issue that i can give is that some people have such a strong desire to be masculine that they desire to change their entire body to match that of a man. That does not make them a man, but that makes them much more masculine than the average woman

>the muslim argument

Most people don’t care what others do. Most people don’t care the muslims don’t eat pork. And muslims usually don’t force others to give up pork. The issue comes when you’re trying to pressure others into subscribing to your views unless they want to be a “bad person”. Once you try and pressure people into saying that male humans can become female humans [which is most often what “trans women are women” is interpreted as, and how it frequently seems to be used (i haven’t seen any body argue that men can’t be feminine)], you’re forcing other people to go against their beliefs, which is where the problem arisesIt's not mundane when the activists are literally trying to change language without consent. That's not how the evolution of language works.

And I'm not cis - I don't 'identify as being female', I just am. I do not have a magical gender identity. I'm not a subset of my own sex. I'm a relatively gender non conforming woman who objects to men claiming womanhood. Just no.

You are too young to remember a time before 'gender' was a thing. It was always used as a synonym for sex. There were no transgender people as they hadn't been invented. Just transexuals who knew very well they were still their natal sex.

You now literally have girls thinking that they can grow a penis if they use cross sex hormones, or that their breast could grow back after a mastectomy if they realise they've made a mistake. Just, no. Leave our kids alone.I wish you the best of luck against the onslaught you'll face against the Catholic church. I do not believe in transgenderism, but ironically I'm also not religious, so in a way the polar opposite of you.

Is  your intention to change Catholicism's perspective on this issue? Do you presume the Christian God agrees with you and the Pope has it wrong? Do you presume the scriptures are incorrect?

As a former Christian who has read the Bible cover to cover twice, I want to test your claim, if you're willing. I still think you're a troll, but you'll earn my respect, even if I disagree with you, if you prove otherwise.If the majority actually do share the concern then they sure are bad about communicating that 😂Banning LGBT books in general (not talking about the inappropriate ones) is bad.I think the part that has gone too far is the complete banning of certain treatment for minors.  There is an issue with applying the treatments when it is completely inappropriate to do so and that needed to be cracked down on, but a completely banning leaves is unjust towards that may legitimately need it.  Instead of banning it completely, a more balanced approach would have been something like a requirement for multiple doctors to sign off on the treatments, along with some kind of protection for doctors that use non-"gender affirming" treatments.  Maybe even making it illegal to give those treatments without at least some minimum number of regular psychological treatment before taking it to the next step.  Something more balanced than a complete ban would have been good.

As for the Budweiser boycott, no, I don't think that's going too far.  Dylan Mulvaney's act is a disgusting mockery of actual trans people and women.  Budweiser deserves every drop in the stock price and sales numbers they've gotten.

As for "banning trans children's books", there is no banning of books happening anywhere in the United States whatsoever.>Their definition doesn’t HAVE to mean ours are wrong. It’s a modification rather than a re-definition.

The same is what trans people ask for, 'woman' still means 'adult human female', but it isn't the *only* definition.

>Also many doesn’t mean much when MOST people are fine with them.

If most people are fine with it, why are most countries either still against gay marriage or against gay people?

If you're only talking about the US, why is gay marriage still one the chopping block almost every election. Almost Half of all republicans are still against gay marriage, adoption, etc.Because you'd be excluding a whole bunch of women such as intersex women, trans women, etc.  
It serves as a demonstration of how language is descriptive rather than prescriptive. For instance, even though a car cannot be pregnant, it is given female pronouns based on cultural tradition. This example highlights the fact that prescribing that any word "should" be used exclusively for one thing in one specific way contradicts the nature of definitions and casual speech.>That refers to like simply straight people. 

... no?  like, thats just not what the word means?  it refers to people who view themselves as their "mind" as having a matching gender to the physical sex that their body has.  it isn't about orientation.  like... you are just factually wrong on thinking it means straight.Well this is wrong. Cis originally means “on this side of”. In terms of gender it means identifying as a gender the same as the sex you were assigned at birth.

It was first used over 100 years ago>the institutional capture of psychologists and surgeons in providing inappropriate procedures and guidance for minors (‘affirming’ care as a rule is wrong and hurts more confused children than it helps)

The guidance being provided is a result of scientific studies and approaches to reducing suicide in trans people. Giving them affirming care is the best solution for reducing the suicide rate in these people and as for procedures for minors; they probably shouldn't happen but they happen in such a low amount that it's easy to see these cases as the rare, acceptable, exception.

There was one study on healthcare insurance claims that found that there was only 54 genital surgeries on minors over 4 years across the whole US. And every case was of a 17 year old. I'm sure if most people knew each of the 54 case facts/situations, we'd accept them.It's similar to the way some people have trouble thinking in words, while others find it unimaginable. As someone who identifies as trans, I haven't given much thought to the connection between your physical being and the concept of "you" being intertwined.My intention is not to make you fully understand the transgender experience, but rather to encourage respect for it. However, I do have some personal insight into the upbringing of boys, as I was raised by my older brother who lacked awareness. I lived as a boy until puberty and have occasionally lived stealth as a man, allowing me to understand how it feels to be treated as such. Nevertheless, my understanding will always be from the perspective of a trans man, which is evident to both myself and other transgender individuals. However, my experiences as a boy or a man do not diminish or invalidate anyone else's experiences. Similarly, prior to my transition, my experiences were vastly different from those commonly associated with being an average woman. I never experienced the fear of alleys or the feelings of vulnerability that some women describe as inherent to womanhood. These experiences were not a result of my biology but rather shaped by social factors. Additionally, reproductive capabilities vary among individuals, and the absence of such abilities does not diminish one's understanding of their gender. I share these personal details not to convince you of the legitimacy of transgender identities, but simply to illustrate that specific body parts only provide a generalized experience, and one's "woman's experience" or "man's experience" is unique to each individual. It is not a rigid standard by which someone should be judged as "enough" of their gender.We agree that children shouldn't be involved. I am specifically referring to adults in this discussion.Yes, I've observed that conservatives expressing increasing hostility towards transgender individuals has led to their exclusion from most of Reddit. I had hoped that someone like Jordan would have the opportunity to understand the perspectives and experiences of some of us in the transgender community. Regardless, thank you for your time and consideration.  
Drawing a comparison between transgender people and psychopaths is fundamentally dishonest. It is evident that someone choosing to live their life differently and desiring to be referred to in a different manner is in no way equivalent to lacking empathy to the extent of manipulating others as mere pawns.  
  
Furthermore, it is important to note that the highest reported dissatisfaction rate with gender transition treatments stands at 13%. Within that subset, approximately 80% attribute their decision to detransition to social pressures rather than being dissatisfied with the treatment itself. This highlights the significance of social factors in detransition experiences rather than solely attributing it to dissatisfaction with the treatment.Trans women haven't broken any women's world records, so saying they've beaten cis women by a long shot is disingenuous.

Plus, this might be a bit pedantic, but trans women are also biological.  
  
While I acknowledge that activists have played a significant role in shaping public perceptions of the transgender identity, I firmly believe that resorting to two wrongs does not make a right. It is essential to recognize that joining in the hostility or negativity towards the transgender community does not benefit the right-wing perspective either.A delusion refers to persistently believing something that is not true. In the case of being transgender, it is a fact that my gender identity does not align with my assigned sex at birth. However, if I were to believe that I am a biological man and attempt to impregnate a woman, that would indeed be a delusion.  
  
Mental illnesses, such as depression, can make life more challenging for individuals, but we don't doubt their experiences. Instead, we strive to alleviate the mental burden through various means, just as transitioning socially or physically can alleviate the mental distress experienced by transgender individuals.  
  
The truth is, if you were to encounter a fully transitioned man without any prior knowledge of his transgender status, you would perceive and address him as a man. This reflects the reality of how our societal understanding of gender operates. It is important to recognize that attempting to alter this perception to fit a particular ideology is artificial. Claiming objectivity in such matters is disingenuous

  
In the example of accommodating a Muslim's dietary preferences while cooking, it is about adjusting our actions out of respect for their religious beliefs. Participating in someone's worldview during an interaction does not change our personal beliefs; it is simply an act of courtesy and understanding. Similarly, respecting and affirming someone's gender identity does not necessitate a change in our own beliefs; it is an expression of empathy"early 1919 opened the Institut für Sexualwissenschaft (the Institute for Sexual Research) on July 6. By 1930 it would perform the first modern gender-affirmation surgeries in the world."  
the acknowledgment of gender and sex as distinct concepts dates back for a considerable period of time. However, until recently, societal acceptance of this separation was minimal, leading many transgender individuals to live stealth and not disclose their identity. This created a perception that there were no trans people around, when in fact they existed but chose not to reveal their status.  
Regarding the experience of "womanhood," I understand that as a gender non-conforming individual, your experience may differ from the average. We can recognize that each person's experience of womanhood is unique, and conforming or non-conforming behavior does not diminish or take away from one another's experiences. Those who conform more closely to societal expectations do not lose anything due to the presence of non-conforming individuals.  
A trans woman's existence does not diminish or undermine the experiences of a cisgender woman. Each person's journey and understanding of womanhood is unique and shaped by their own circumstances.The Pope did express his belief that all people should be welcomed in the Church; however, this stance was later retracted by others within the Church. Many nuns have also written letters advocating for the baptism of transgender and gay individuals. I am hopeful that this positive change will continue to happen.  
  
In terms of historical and biblical context, there is only a slight mention of transgender people in Deuteronomy. It states that men should not wear women's clothes, and vice versa. This was part of a covenant between the Jewish people to separate themselves from other cultures and be recognized as God's chosen people. It likely refers to cultural practices, such as dressing up as certain gods, and some translations even suggest it refers to non-combatants wearing shields and armor.  
  
Regardless, as a Catholic, I don't follow kosher dietary laws because Jesus fulfilled the previous covenant, making it inapplicable to me. As for homosexuality, it seems evident to me that the incident where the townspeople in Sodom and Gomorrah attempted to rape the visiting angels is an example of condemning violent behavior rather than addressing the concept of homosexuality as we understand it today. It seems unreasonable to suggest that the Bible is referring to a later concept of homosexuality rather than the actions described within its own text.As I mentioned before, it's difficult for anyone to fully grasp the transgender experience without having lived it themselves. It's understandable that someone might be hesitant to engage in conversation with someone who appears to harbor animosity towards them simply for their existence. I want to clarify that I'm not suggesting you hold such feelings, but rather pointing out the way you might be perceived based on your expressions.>'woman' still means 'adult human female', but it isn't the only definition.

you either don't understand their argument or just choosing to ignore what I said. Either way come back when you actually want to have a discussion rather than just yelling at people."excluding a whole bunch of women such as intersex women, trans women" say that again, but slowly this time..-Those people are incredibly rare compared to the rest. Exceptions don't make the rules.Women with disorders of sexual development ('intersex women') are still women. Transwomen are men.

It's really not hard to understand.Then does it make sense that when you say anyone can be a woman,or even a man,or both,then it loses value. When it encompasses anyone then it can be anyone and therefore has no actual true definition. Woman used to mean one thing and now it can be anyone or anything,so to me at least it has no value because it is vague. If I can be both a man and a woman at the same time or I can change them why define it?
This is not about a social construct. Some boys are or have feminine traits,or so society says,but that doesn't mean they are all a sudden something else. There is nothing wrong with a boy or girl having traits that are not to the social norms. Or at least there shouldn't be.This is a circular argument. You're using the word you are trying to define within the definition you are trying to explain.So do we do away with the terms intersex,trans-woman and name them all women? If they are all women then just say so. Why have all the other names?
There are men and women. Forget all the subsets.That’s not what folks are arguing about. Many of these men think they are indeed women, in every sense of the word. 

Do you not think it may be harmful to ask a child to believe that something which is actually quite serious and quite rare, is actually common and normal? That all this time it was just a huge misunderstanding?

We all understand damn well that there is an exceedingly small percentage of the population that is trans, and a much larger percentage that are not sound-of-mind and simply grifting—using the whole idea as a shield to hide behind while they engage in deranged behavior or ride the gravy train to victimhood.It just refers to people who are normal and we don't need a new word for that.   Only people entrenched in some fringe internet "community" of abnormals would have the use for, and narcissistic audacity to push for the use of, a prefix to label normal people in contrast to themselves.I still don’t like the word, but I’m upvoting your comment because it is the honest thing to do when a comment is true.The transgender experience is something I have nothing to do with. I will never experience that,just as I won't experience what it is to be a woman. 
I am not sure what you mean by respect for their experience?  It exists and is separate from me. I don't know any so I have no reason to know of their experiences,or what it is like to be one. They are people. They are suffering just like all of us in this life. Just with different things. If it is a mental illness then it is. It's not wrong or right. It just is. Just like any other emotional or mental issues or suffering. 
I don't know of anyone that doesn't have some sort of issues or isn't suffering some sort of emotional troubles. 
It's like being gay or lesbian. On the religious side of things. If it is wrong in a God's eyes then it is just added to all the other wrongs or "sins" a person might have. 

So why hate one sin or sinner above another. Not saying you do. Just in general.It's not dishonest. I'm not saying trans people are psycopaths. But I am saying that both conditions exist completely in the mind. 

The problem is when you legally compel me to affirm your self-perception. 

If you can articulate why I should affirm a transgendered person's self perception and not a trans racial or trans species person then I will withdraw my objection.  

The answer must be logically consistent and cannot just handwaved away the other conditions.I'm no expert, but a little googling seems to suggest trans women have broken several world records. And yea, I guess I should have said biological females or biologically female women.I agree with you that, two wrongs don’t make a right.  Though I do disagree that the right wing has joined hostility.  We’ve been pushed too far and finally standing up for ourselves.  Enough is enough, we gave an inch yet 10 miles we’re taken.  Now we want to go back to the inch and that’s considered hostility?>it is a fact that my gender identity does not align

this is another can of worms. but to sum up my perspective, a person can act feminine without broadcasting it to the entire world. You do not need to be transgender, simply act as feminine [masculine in your case] as you wish. Simply changing your pronouns to he/him will not make the average person regard you as more masculine than they would the average woman

>you would perceive and address him as a man

and if a transgender individual didn’t know someone supported jk rowling’s views on trans women, they’d happily be friends with them. That’s the nature of ignorance

>adjusting our actions

A muslim man asking a chef to make a dish without pork is not the same as a muslim man asking the chef to stop eating porkWikipedia is no longer a reputable source of information. Yes, there were those that dabbled with cross dressing and surgical options, but it was not called 'gender affirming care' back then. 

This historical revisionism is very alarming. Gender non conforming people have existed in many cultures, but transgender is a recent invention.

The only universal experience of womanhood is that which our sexed bodies confer on us. So, in my view, men can never experience womanhood, just as you can never experience manhood.

I have been through pregnancy and birth twice. No man will ever, ever understand this process and how it affects a woman. Same for menstruation, lactation etc. And a women will never know what it is to be a man. And that's okay. That is simple reality.

I'm sorry you don't feel comfortable in your body, and have decided that it is better to hide in a lie than try to align your body with your reality, but no, I will not change my reality to accommodate people like you.So you believe the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob would approve of your lifestyle and welcome you with open arms? 

Don't get me wrong. I approve just fine, even if I don't see it the same way. But the God of the Bible was pretty dickish to sexual deviants and always has been.I don’t want to talk to anyone, I want to see them publicly say kids shouldn’t be given surgeries and drugs. You say most of the community is against it… where are the voices saying that? You’re letting a loud supposed minority dictate the narrative.You claimed that gay marriage was a modification to existing word, i'm saying the same , woman can still mean adult human female, but trans women can also exist within that definition.I never said exceptions make the rule, but exceptions are not discarded just because they're exceptions. Trans women are exceptions to the definition of 'woman'.Trans women also have disorders with brain development, which is why they have brains that are more female-like than male-like.The answer is somewhere in between "adult human female" and "anyone", but ideally there shouldn't be any inherent value or difference between men and women. Everyone should be treated the same.

>If I can be both a man and a woman at the same time or I can change them why define it?

One can define it for themselves.

>This is not about a social construct. Some boys are or have feminine traits,or so society says,but that doesn't mean they are all a sudden something else. There is nothing wrong with a boy or girl having traits that are not to the social norms.

I don't know why people keep bringing this up, a boy doesn't have to be feminine to be trans, nobody is saying that feminine boys are trans.I'm not writing a definition?

I'm just saying that "adult human female" excludes a lot of women.>So do we do away with the terms intersex,trans-woman and name them all women? 

No, they're all women, and they are women with certain characteristics that make them trans, intersex. Like tall women or black women.We agree that children shouldn't be involved. I am specifically referring to adults in this discussion.

As a trans person who has interacted with and listened to many other trans individuals, I must point out that the narrative of trans people believing they are biologically the gender they identify with is a misconception perpetuated by a vocal fringe minority. Just as most women do not hold the extreme view of wanting to "kill all men," there are unhinged individuals who have expressed such sentiments, but they do not represent the majority.> It just refers to people who are normal and we don't need a new word for that.

whats the harm in being specific/explicit in your meaning?  like, why is it better to be vague and expect everyone to presume being on the same page without saying what you mean?

>Only people entrenched in some fringe internet "community" of abnormals would have the use for, and narcissistic audacity to push for the use of, a prefix to label normal people in contrast to themselves.

how do you distinguish between "abnormal" and "a regularly occurring but minority variation of experience"? 

even if you want to argue for a very narrow essential definition of abnormal, I think its disingenuous to not acknowledge that "abnormal", or just not being in the "normal" group, has baggage to it.  

Do you see normalcy as something positive or admirable?  as something to be proud of or confident about?  is that a good thing?Claiming that non-trans people are normal makes it seem like trans people are abnormal (not in the statistical sense).

Also, this is the exact argument people had against gay people.> It just refers to people who are normal and we don't need a new word for that

You use the word straight to describe someone who isn't gay. How is that different? Are you really asking why adjectives exist that if they apply to less than 50% of a population? That's most adjectives.Appreciated, I assume people downvoted for a perception of opinion. What I said was fact, I didn’t share my view on use of the wordI reckon you can still downvote a comment if you disagree with its message, even if it’s objectively, factually trueIn general, it seems we agree that being transgender is simply a natural aspect of some individuals, and that respecting others should transcend political alignments. My perspective is that the right, as a collective, is currently not striking the right balance between respect and questioning, particularly when compared to how they approached this issue in the past.Autism exists in the mind, but it is not a delusion. The heightened perception of sensory stimuli can be considered a distortion of perception. The most effective treatment for autism often involves modifying the environment to accommodate the individual's needs, such as using headphones to manage sensory overload. Conversely, telling a depressed person that "everyone dose hates you" is not an appropriate approach. Different mental conditions require different treatments tailored to each individual's needs.

Gender identity is supported by scientific evidence, with a disconnect between assigned sex and deeply ingrained gender identity often leading to gender dysphoria. Gender transition treatments have been proven effective in alleviating distress. In contrast, there is no scientific evidence supporting trans racial or trans species identities. Race is a social construct, while species is a biological classification, making the concept of being trans species biologically implausible.>The problem is when you legally compel me to affirm your self-perception.

Harassing someone based on their gender identity is also bad.>I'm no expert, but a little googling seems to suggest trans women have broken several world records.

Can you link them?there is often a fundamental misunderstanding of the transgender experience. While I can only speak for myself, I want to emphasize that there is overlap among many transgender individuals. I have contemplated being a masculine woman, as many trans men have, and I have even tried living in that way. However, it simply wasn't enough for me to feel truly understood and authentic. I understand that you may not perceive me as a man, but it's important to acknowledge that you do not know the people I interact with and how they perceive me. Transitioning has had a profound impact on how I am treated, and during the times I have been stealth, I have finally found a sense of comfort and authenticity within myself that is indescribable.

  
  
Similar to the feeling of slipping off a pair of work boots after a long, exhausting 12-hour shift, there is a profound sense of relief that accompanies aligning yourself with how others see you. It's like shedding a heavy burden

  
Just as you don't have to stop eating pork for someone who follows a different religious belief, you don't have to believe that I am a man. However, purposefully misgendering me is akin to intentionally mixing all the food together because you don't believe in hell. It is a malicious act[https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-forgotten-history-of-the-worlds-first-trans-clinic/](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-forgotten-history-of-the-worlds-first-trans-clinic/)

I have to ask, why does the introduction of a new word to describe something that you acknowledge already exists, evoke such a strong reaction? Just like the evolution of language gave us the term "car" to replace "Motorwagen," it's a natural progression in our communication. The purpose of language is to express and understand concepts, and as society evolves, so does our vocabulary.When people appeal to nature, it implies that individuals who are unable to reproduce somehow lack a gender. It also suggests that a woman who cannot conceive would lose her womanhood. However, this perspective is not grounded in factual evidence but rather stems from an insecurity about one's own womanhood. Relying solely on reproduction as the defining characteristic of womanhood overlooks the diversity of experiences and traits that encompass femininity. 

  
Everyone has their own reality shaped by their biases and experiences, and that's perfectly understandable. The only issue arises when one projects their reality onto others and assumes that those who don't share the same perspective are unworthy of respect. I want to make it clear that I respect you entirely, even though I may disagree with you in this particular instance.  
As I mentioned before, when examining the Bible and its historical context, I personally believe that it has very little direct relevance to my transgender identity. However, what I do find within its pages are stories of individuals who defied expectations and overcame. For instance, Jacob deceive his father, he wrestled with God and yet received blessings. Jesus, too, said and did things that were perplexing to the early church. And let us not forget that God chose Moses, who had killed a man, to lead the chosen people. In my interpretation of the Bible, it is a book that celebrates the resilience and love of outcasts and unique individuals. It took me a considerable amount of prayer and introspection to find peace and acceptance within myself and with God, and I am confident in that understanding.  
understand that I have repeatedly expressed my stance against involving children in certain discussions and decisions regarding transgender issues. It seems that despite my clear statement, there is a perception that the transgender community as a whole is somehow targeting children. is it possible that this perception might stem from a deep-seated resistance to accepting transgender individuals rather than an accurate representation of your beliefs? We must separate the actions of a small minority from the broader transgender community>You claimed that gay marriage was a modification to existing word, i'm saying the same , woman can still mean adult human female, but trans women can also exist within that definition.

sure I can spell it out for you.

does the change of marriage to include gays actually affect anyone but the gays themselves?

the answer is no

the change of definition of woman IS affecting the smallest things from bathrooms, sport participation, to life and death issue of medical practices.Yes. It's called a fetish. See: autogynophilia.First I didn't mean that a boy or girl with "opposite" traits makes them trans. People are who they are. Male with feminine traits is just that. Same with "Tom boys". Doesn't make them anything, especially trans. Boys with feminine traits also don't make them gay. 

Men and women have different values inherent to them as that sex,not gender,but even more so because who they are as individuals. 

I don't think we will ever get to being a society that treats me and women the same. I don't think it is necessary. I see no reason to treat or expect the same from males and females. 

If the ship is going down so to speak, you don't treat people the same. If you need certain things done then,in general of course, you go to a biological sex that can do what you need done. 
Of course this is not true is all things,but only in a few. 
For the most part men and women are the same. Just in the extremes do they differ. 

As I see it.Mostly you mean it excludes males who wish to present as females since the definition of woman for all of us was always a female human  until a few years back. When we use the term woman or women in a conversation we are referring to a female human. Something that can give birth to offspring, breast feeds etc.

What seems to be the heart of this issue is whether the term "she" can be used for both trans woman - a male who feels female ("born in the wrong body") and a conventional woman. 

I would refer to a trans woman as just that ; a trans-woman. Never as a woman. But I would use the term she if that was preferred out of a spirit of toleration and acceptance.So anything that is not a man. I assume men also have the same subset,if that is even the right word? 
I disagree that a tall woman or a woman of a certain race is a subset of women the same as trans. A trans woman has more in common with a male outside of how they identify or feel. Biologically speaking. 

In that case we can identify as monkeys because we have just as much in common with them as a man does to a woman? There is very little difference between humans and monkeys. Obviously consciousness being the biggest one. 

I just don't understand the concept. It's not that I can't read what it is, being trans,but I just can't comprehend it. Of course I can't comprehend being gay. Not saying it is wrong.I only know one trans fella, and he said more-or-less the same thing. But like all things, it’s always the extremists that control the narrative.>whats the harm in being specific/explicit in your meaning? 

What's the need for everyone to adopt usage of a prefix to denote a normal man or woman defined in contrast to men and women with very rare conditions?  "Because a tiny minority demand it" is not valid justification.

>like, why is it better to be vague and expect everyone to presume being on the same page without saying what you mean?

It's not vague. If I say that I met a woman, everyone already correctly presumes that I'm talking about a woman. Virtually nobody would wonder if I'm talking about a transwoman, because if I was, I would have used the trans prefix.  

>how do you distinguish between "abnormal" and "a regularly occurring but minority variation of experience"? 

When a variation of mental experience happens to only a very small minority of people, such as with transgenderism or schizophrenia, that variation is abnormal. 

>even if you want to argue for a very narrow essential definition of abnormal, I think its disingenuous to not acknowledge that "abnormal", or just not being in the "normal" group, has baggage to it. 

Obviously there can be negative connotations to a thing or person not being in the normal group. 

>Do you see normalcy as something positive or admirable? as something to be proud of or confident about? is that a good thing?

Normalcy in general has positive connotations of familiarity, stability, safety and order. I don't think being normal is anything to be proud of or confident about. Being normal can be good in ways; so can being abnormal.Trans people are literally abnormal, regardless of what stating that fact makes it seem like to you.  

And you've misunderstood if you interpreted my comment to be an argument against trans people.>You use the word straight to describe someone who isn't gay. How is that different? 

Good question. For one thing, being gay is so common that I have occasionally found practical use in denoting when someone is heterosexual, as opposed to homosexual. I've had no such use to denote that someone is not trans. Maybe people who spend a lot of time around trans people would find more use in it, but I don't imagine most people would. Another difference is that use of "cis" implies belief in gender identity ideology which I don't hold, whereas "straight" doesn't.

>Are you really asking why adjectives exist that if they apply to less than 50% of a population? 

No, I am not asking that.People on Reddit don’t tend to understand that. Conservatives are much better about it than leftists, though.Why? I wasn’t posing an opinion so it’s a statement of fact. I don’t think it’s a word people really have to worry about using too often, it’s only necessary in a specific conversation about trans. I can’t say that I’ve ever said the word out loudWhat message is there to disagree with? It’s beneficial to know it’s old so you don’t look ignorant in a debate. The factual comment was nothing but helpful.No I don't agree that transgender is a "natural aspect" of some individuals. Unless you consider and mean that any mental illness is "natural". It is called gender dysphoria for a reason. It is outside the normal. This doesn't make it wrong any more than being gay or straight.  It also doesn't make it right. 
By natural I mean the way nature is by the biggest percentage. There is always those things outside the normal,but I would never consider it wrong or something to be hated. I will never understand how it feels to be gay or transgender nor do I care too. 
I can't even understand myself sometimes. :)

The right as you call it,and I assume you mean the extreme,and not the normal right,can and do not strike a balance. We agree on that. They just hate. Or strongly dislike. LGBTQ are "others" and to be abhorred. I have a family member on that end. Considers himself a Christian,all while hating on that group. Personally I think he is just scared of what is so different. He also hates pork products so there is that. 

If true transgender and gender dysphoria is an illness as it has been in the past then it can't be anymore natural than other mental illnesses. It isn't natural to be BP or BPD,or even anorexic. It's an issue that people have to work thru. Those that hate people who struggle,are weak people as I see them. I am no expert and do not know or really care if transgender/gender dysphoria is an "illness". 

I do have an issue with being "forced" to celebrate or even accept LBGTQ people. I don't have to and no one should hate them or discriminate against them and I don't. 

I do agree that people should listen and watch their own biases when discussing these types of topics. It doesn't hurt to listen,or it shouldn't.I thought that gender is also a social construct? Is this not true or is it a natural order so to speak?
Race is not a social construct is it? Culture is for sure. The culture of a person of a different race is  not the same the world over. I white person from the south isn't the same as a white person from South America. But they are still white. 
A woman in China will still have periods as a woman does from the US. Culture has a huge effect,but doesn't change some biological facts. 
Are we mixing culture and science?I agree. What do you define as harassment?

I define harassment as not using someone's preferred pronouns. 

No response on my question?>it simply wasn’t enough for me

and thus, the issue of separating sex and gender, and the trans rights movement saying it’s about gender. Clearly, simply being masculine isn’t enough, so you want to become a man. You’re an adult, you can do as you wish, but you’re clearly aware that you’re not the same as a biological man, so not everyone will treat you like one

>purposefully 

going against someone’s wishes feels more disrespectful to me than I’m usually comfortable with, so i’ll tend to resort to gender neutral pronouns [they/them] for trans or otherwise “nonbinary” individuals. I am amused you compare misgendering to mixing together someone’s food, though. Christians say not to invoke the lord’s name in vain, and yet people say “Jesus Christ” casually constantly. Does that not constitute disrespectful/malicious behavior? Is everyone expected to avoid saying “jesus christ” because they might offend some christians?Scientific American also stopped being a reputable source a long time ago.I'm an infertile woman. Still a woman. That was not what I was implying and you know it. That is a disingenuous argument.

I'll soon be menopausal. Will still be a woman.

A woman born with a disorder of sexual development is still a woman.

A person born male, never a woman.

Reality, thankfully, is not shaped by people's feelings, but by facts.

And nothing I said implies a lack of respect for an individual. I can respect you as a person and still never believe you are a man.Oh I think it's absolutely possible to come at peace with one's self and with The Creator, but I don't think the Bible paints a very clear picture as to the nature of how creation works, what we see around us, as well as our souls.

*"I do find within its pages are stories of individuals who defied expectations and overcame."*

While there is some truth to this, it is often at the expense of other individuals or nations. While there is some argument over whether Jehovah actually hardening Pharaoh's heart is a translation error or not, Jehovah still made Moses play the long-game that involved innocent people as pawns in order to demonstrate his powers to the rules of Egypt.

Killing the first-born of every father, both Egyptian and Israelite, unless the blood of a pure and innocent animal was smeared all over your doors? Only telling your Chosen One the secret so you can make an example out of the children of non-believers?

This is all the work of Devils and Demons, not a benevolent and loving god. ***\*ARCHETYPICALLY\**** so. Both the use of innocent blood to ward off bad things happening to you, AND the use of innocent children as pawns to demonstrate your power.

So while you say, "defied expectations and overcame" I in turn say, "Easy to do that when you have a demon god on your side and are willing to massacre those that disagree with you and your God's outlook."

And it gets soooo much worse after the Israelites actually leave Egypt and go to war. No one ever tells you growing up that Moses permits the Israelites to frequently rape their female captors as they conquer nations, and that's really just the tip of the problematic Biblical iceberg.

Abraham being required to sacrifice Isaac as a test of his (demonic) loyalty is another great example of Jehovah's true character, and those that followed him.

Point being, I don't see God accepting the misfits until Jesus. Rather, I see Jehovah using men that demonstrate perfect obedience, like Moses, who was willing to send 7 plagues to Egypt and destroy lots of innocent Egyptians, including newborn babies. As well as Abraham, who proved to his god that he'd kill his own son and offer his blood up as an energetic sacrifice if he was asked. \*Loyalty\* and \*obidence\* were more important to Jehovah than anything else. It's why he almost killed Moses when he didn't circumcize one of his kids.

I would even debate with JP over this. The archetypes of Moses and Abraham have little to nothing virtuous about them, unless \*unquestioning loyalty and mindless obedience\* is a virtue one has.You don’t seem to get it. Way more of your “community” are vocalizing support for involving children than not. I frankly don’t care about your personal stance and it’s not really relevant to the point anyway. You’re one example. And you don’t know for a fact that the broader community is against this, you don’t have data for that.>the change of definition of woman IS affecting the smallest things from bathrooms, sport participation, to life and death issue of medical practices.

Bathroom laws are stupid since anyone can enter or exit regardless of what the law is, and rapists are not going to be deterred by a silly law, rape is already illegal.

This law is only going to affect non-passing trans women and gender non conforming cis women.

Sports participation is to do with sex, not gender, trans women can be women and still be allowed/disallowed from playing.

Medical practitioners will have their medical records, and trans women are encouraged to reveal their trans status with their doctors. So i don't see how it will affect anyone (other than trans people).AGP has been debunked several times, when done on cis women, turns out most cis women have AGP.>First I didn't mean that a boy or girl with "opposite" traits makes them trans.

Definitions change over time, and yes, some women are born male.

>When we use the term woman or women in a conversation we are referring to a female human. Something that can give birth to offspring, breast feeds etc.

First off, women are not things, and second not all women can give birth, breast feed, etc. Now you're excluding a lot of cis women as well.

>What seems to be the heart of this issue is whether the term "she" can be used for both trans woman - a male who feels female ("born in the wrong body") and a conventional woman.

No, women are humans, not objects.

>I disagree that a tall woman or a woman of a certain race is a subset of women the same as trans. A trans woman has more in common with a male outside of how they identify or feel. Biologically speaking.

If we are speaking about commonality, then a black woman living as a nomad in the Sahara has more in common with her brother (in almost every way) than a woman living in Iceland.

So to the woman in Iceland, the woman in Sahara is more of a man than a woman?

Also, this point is not relevant for trans women who have transitioned, who have more in common with females than males, most of the same risks medically, most of the societal advantages and disadvantages, etc.

> In that case we can identify as monkeys because we have just as much in common with them as a man does to a woman? There 

No, monkey is a different species, but we are the same class as a monkey, and had common ancestors so we never stopped being a "monkey".

It's just more precise and conveys no negative connotation.   Why object? 

>It's not vague. If I say that I met a woman, everyone already correctly presumes that I'm talking about a woman.

Ok but that's the thing,  that IS vague. 

When you say a woman is that referring to a social role or a reproductive role? Is it an identity or a private medical detail? 

There are people who according to medical details and reproductive role are "women" but who I would absolutely not describe as one.Yes, trans people are abnormal in the statistical sense, but 'normal' and 'abnormal' aren't always used that way.

"not normal" has negative connotations as in being "not right".>  being gay is common enough

lol so this is some arbitrary percentage that needs to be met? 

Seems like a weird thing to get so emotional over when apparently the argument boils down to "well I just don't think it's really all that useful".

Not saying you necessarily in terms of that "emotional" jab, just the clowns like Peterson who are calling it a slur. 

>  For another thing, use of "cis" implies belief in gender identity ideology which I don't hold.

No it doesn't. It implies the reality that other people hold that belief. 

There are people who are trans and there are people who aren't. It's just a word for "people who aren't trans", it's not complex. Your belief of gender identity or the "validity" of trans people is completely irrelevant to the existence of trans people.That’s not often my experience, but I’d say there’s people on both “sides” that are absolutely as bad as each other.

I’d imagine most of us are pretty centrist overall - we probably have mixed views on various things, but that often gives us a sense of perspective or seeing each others view.

Not so much on Reddit I’d admit, and Reddit *seems* more left leaning to me.>i wasn’t posing an opinion

If i said “a woman is an adult human female” on a transgender subreddit, i’d be downvoted into oblivion despite that literally being the dictionary definition of “woman”. Why? Because it’s viewed as an attack on their belief that “trans women are women”>what message

defending the use of the term “cisgender”. not saying i agree or disagree, or even that they meant for that to be the message [apparently not], but that’s evidently the conclusion some people drewFirstly, I want to address the term "natural." When I use the term, I mean something that exists in or is caused by nature, rather than equating it with what is average or typical. Mistakes in psychology or variations in human experiences can be considered natural because they occur in the natural world and throughout different cultures.  
  
Secondly, I understand your point about labeling transgenderism as a "mental illness." It raises concerns similar to calling autism a mental illness. While these labels may be technically accurate, they can imply that both conditions require similar treatment approaches. However, we know that attempting to make autistic individuals conform to societal norms can have negative effects, whereas accommodating their needs can lead to better outcomes. Similarly, different approaches are needed when addressing the challenges faced by individuals with anorexia.  
  
Ultimately, we can agree that disagreement should not automatically lead to disrespect.Race and culture are distinct entities, completely independent of each other. It is solely based on one's physical appearance that people tend to make assumptions. For instance, an individual can possess Caucasian features and yet have grown up in China, fully immersed in Chinese culture.  


To emphasize, race is unequivocally a social construct that holds minimal sway over an individual's experiences and interactions in the world. On the other hand, gender profoundly impacts every aspect of one's existence, from forming friendships to pursuing certain types of work, and beyond. If, for any reason, this delicate equilibrium is disrupted and fails to align with how others perceive and acknowledge you, it can render life incredibly challenging to navigate.  
race does not have this.  


We are constantly intertwining science and culture, as science provides us with a collection of factual knowledge, while culture dictates how we choose to interpret and apply that information.>I define harassment as not using someone's preferred pronouns.

I guess that, if done intentionally and despite knowing that it causes harm.The Bible says for me not to take the Lord's name in vain, not you. However, you admit it's weird and confrontational to misgender trans people, so at the very least, we can agree on that.  
1. If you only rely on sources that align with your preexisting views, it raises concerns about the validity of those views. History has shown us this place was real, and denying its existence suggests a lack of sincerity in the discussion.  
  
2. The terms "man" and "woman" are linguistic constructs, and their boundaries are determined by societal consensus. What falls under these categories is entirely based on what society deems useful and meaningful. It is worth noting that a significant portion of Americans, at least 50%, are comfortable using gender-affirming language. Calling someone like myself a man has never caused confusion or ambiguity, indicating that the words are utilized in a way that effectively communicates and reflects objective reality. On the other hand, deliberately misgendering a woman who presents and identifies as female based solely on chromosomes has been known to cause confusion. Therefore, from the perspective of language usage, it is objectively incorrect to misgender transgender individuals.Also why do you emphasize reproduction as an integral part of gender if you don't believe it to be so?  
I created this post to specifically discuss transgenderism, and I believe your perspective may stem from a misunderstanding of the Bible. However, delving into biblical interpretation is a separate and complex topic. If you're genuinely interested in exploring the Bible and its meaning, I recommend checking out "The Bible Project." They do an excellent job of using historical and biblical context to make the text more accessible and understandable. While they mostly avoid discussions on gender and homosexuality, though I believe history debunks that misconception fairly easily.I don't believe that all conservatives want to "eradicate trans people." While it is true that a few individuals have expressed such extreme views, it appears that the online disconnect amplifies the voices of a vocal minority, which may be influencing your perception of trans people as a whole. It's important to remember that we can't control the actions of others, but we can control our own behavior and attitudes. Projecting negative experiences with a handful of people onto those who had no involvement in them is disturbing and leads to unfair generalizationsyou literally just proved my point that trans ideology affects many things and that's why people don't like it.>It's just more precise and conveys no negative connotation. Why object? 

It's unnecessary, provides no benefit to me or anyone I speak with, and as I don't accept the gender identity ideology that the prefix implies belief in, I'd feel dishonest and foolish using it.

>Ok but that's the thing, that IS vague. 

>When you say a woman is that referring to a social role or a reproductive role? Is it an identity or a private medical detail? 

I disagree. I'm willing to bet that virtually 100% of people - including you - correctly presume that when I say "woman" I'm referring to an adult human female, unless otherwise specified. 

>There are people who according to medical details and reproductive role are "women" but who I would absolutely not describe as one.

Suit yourself.Abnormal, unusual, different from 99.whatever% of everyone else...that's just what it is, regardless of whether anyone perceives negative connotations. To be honest, I'm really not sure what point you're getting at.I answered your questions. Whether you're playing dumb or legitimately not able to understand my perspective, that's ok. Given that the first word of your last response was "lol" it's clear you're not engaging in good faith so I think we're done here.I agree, but I think it’s taken as provocative by some. Not saying that’s right or wrong but it’s said a lot by some not so nice people.

I didn’t just come here and post about cisgender, I was reading comments and read an incorrect description of the word and just corrected them.

I don’t use the term myself, and would only do so in very specific conversations (that admittedly I don’t really get involved in!)You would, because conservatives are usually much better about upvoting the truth than are liberals. The left is more emotional, while the right is more logical. 

The left’s downvoting of facts and rejection of rational debate are some of their most embarrassing qualities on this website.

I have always pointed out factual or logical flaws on both sides, despite being very conservative. It’s the meaning of my username. 

The truth is what’s important. When you downvote the truth, you are acting to suppress the truth.Yes we can agree that disagreement doesn't need to lead to disrespect and for sure hatred or oppression. 

As it relates to conforming to societal norms for anyone. They shouldn't have to, unless it involves breaking the law of course. Some mental illnesses have toxic or violent side affects. It doesn't make them bad  people,but it is not something that society will have to accept. 
But on the other side society shouldn't have to conform to a autistic person either. Or transgender,or anyone else. 
Maybe this is what bothers those on the right. It seems that those extremes are wanting pushing for society to conform to them, because they don't want to conform to society. 

So as in a relationship. You can't expect one to change or force change, because it will cause some blowback or at the least defensiveness. 

They(LGBTQ) seem to be pushing for change in "normal" people and if they are not accepting them then there is blowback. 

We can agree most of this is on the extremes I think. 

Most people don't like change, especially conservative people. Much less being forced on them to change how they view life and certainly their religion and God.Mental illnesses are not to be treated with the same approaches. Even the same illness because people are individuals with different backgrounds and issues for the illness. Although some are biological in part I believe.I disagree with some of that if I am understanding you right. The left is all about,at least lately,gender and race. They assume that because a person is white or even black that they are attributed certain things in life. One of suppression and one of oppressor. Same with gender. One is an oppressor and one is suppressed. The typical white male hatred or dislike by the extreme left. Or the hatred of blacks on the extreme right. 

I assume most of this is about culture. We tend to stick to our own,even if it is race,but a lot of it is culture. 

To say race doesn't render life incredibly challenging is probably not true. All races have challenges,some more than others. Each culture has the same.No. That's not harassment. At worst it's being rude. At best it's me affirming to you how I see the world.>says for me

My understanding is that in general, just as adultery, using the lord’s name in vain is a sin, no matter who does it. Christians, obviously, try to avoid sinning, so they’ll avoid using the lord’s name in vain. But i’d think that other people sinning also upsets them, just as other people committing crimes would upset most people. So, in order to avoid upsetting christians, do we avoid saying “god” and “jesus” casually?

>you admit

that’s my attitude on it, yes, but not everyone shares that sentimentGender is meaningless. Reproduction is a fundamental part of sex.>*"I created this post to specifically discuss transgenderism"*

That's a dime-a-dozen topic here. The questions you're asking have been asked by frstrated JP fans and JP haters alike countless times. I'm bored of those, because I learn nothing new.

A believing transgender CATHOLIC on the other hand... you're interesting.

"The Bible Project" merely existing implies that the default state of the scriptures is indeed in a horrible, poorly written, poorly translated state that requires an absurd amount of compartmentalizing to accept as truth. Such projects wouldn't be necessary if the Bible, by default, brought clarity... which it does not in most instances. Rather, it creates, and is responsible for, massive division.

Abraham was evil. Moses was evil. Full stop. It was a tribal kind of evil. Selfishness that extended beyond one's self to the tribe, but stopped at the tribal lines. Jehovah was just that kind of God.

I've read the Bible cover to cover twice along with thousands of pages of study guides. If you're not capable of directly responding to my comments about Abraham and Moses and have to refer to me to a third party, that's truly a shame.

Honestly, a transgender worshipping the God of Abraham is one of the weirdest things I've ever seen, for better or worse. To be fair, I'd like it if your version of God was more popular in Christian circles, but your version of God ignores parts of the Bible itself in order to exist, and therefore is even more fictional than the standard version of Jehovah, if such a thing is possible.There are large groups of LGBT people in real life chanting in support of this stuff you’re claiming not that many people support, idgaf what people are saying on the internet lolNo, you pretend that it affects anything, nobody cared about trans women in bathrooms, sports is based on biology and not gender, which is why trans men who haven't transitioned are men who compete in women's sports, etc.

And i don't even know how it affects medical practices in any way.The point is that saying that trans people are abnormal has negative connotations, i would use a different word. But its mostly semantics.Or I thought what you said was nonsensical. 

The existence of terminology is not dependent on your subjective,  personal criteria.>just corrected them

I think your adding that it’s been used for a while was taken the wrong way. While, yes, “cis” is a scientific term used in chemistry, it hasn’t been used in describing gender/identity/etc. until very recently, and it’s not a term that people want to be normalized that way>the truth is what’s important 

I resonate with your attitude, and agree that facts matter. However, i think it’s equally important to avoid being disingenuous about issues. A lot of people on the right, in regards to that video from the “gay men’s choir”, focus on the “we’ll convert your children” bit, despite the lyric very clearly continuing as “to be generous and kind”. whether or not that’s true is a different issue. the same deal here. Their post was viewed as defending the usage of “cisgender”, regardless of whether or not that was actually the intention, regardless of whether or not their post was factually accurateI believe your intention may not be to convey this perspective, but it appears as though you are suggesting that we shouldn't accommodate certain individuals. I fail to see any substantial change we are asking for, apart from a shift in how we communicate with one another. Just like the advocates for gay marriage had to redefine the concept of marriage, it wasn't about forcing them to alter their own marriages. It was simply about requesting respect when we say, 'This is my husband,' even if others don't share the same belief of what 'marriage' or a 'husband' means.Being rude repeatedly with the intent of causing harm is harassment.Please correct me if I'm mistaken, but it seems that there is some inconsistency in your statements regarding the defining characteristic of being a woman. Initially, you mentioned that reproduction was the defining characteristic, but later you implied that there are other factors beyond reproduction that determine one's womanhood, and now you've gone back Could you clarify which perspective you align with?  
  
Additionally, I want to address the broader question of gender. If gender is solely based on reproductive capabilities, then why do we have gender distinctions beyond reproductive functions? For instance, why do we use phrases like "talk like a girl" or "walks like a boy"? These phrases seem unrelated to reproduction. Are we implying that someone is talking like a pregnant person or walking like they have sperm? It raises the question of what criteria we use to define and assign gender roles and expectations.  
  
The reason I mentioned different perspectives and realities is because I approach the world by accepting people's self-identifications and trusting that adults are honest about their own experiences and identities. In contrast, it appears that you have a different approach, where you establish rules to determine who people are without their input. While I find this approach unconventional, I acknowledge that everyone is entitled to live according to their own beliefs and perspectives.I've changed my mind, by the way, all the other comments are questions I already answered so I don't feel a need to continue those.  


If you perceive the Bible as a strict set of rules, it may indeed appear as a convoluted collection. However, if you approach it as a poetic narrative that encapsulates spirituality, psychology, and sociology, as I personally believe it to be, it becomes evident that it warrants a meticulous study, akin to delving into multiple textbooks intricately woven together, each with its own purpose entwined within the writing itself. This complexity does not diminish its value or quality.  


While I won't defend their actions, I find the term 'evil' to be a reactionary label aimed at evoking emotions. I disagree with that phrasing. However, it is true that they committed harmful acts because, unfortunately, people are capable of doing bad things. This is precisely the issue with interpreting the Bible solely as a set of rules. It's understandable, especially if one has a Baptist background, to approach it that way. Yet, this perspective of viewing the Bible is relatively new. Redemption is a prominent theme that necessitates the portrayal of individuals who have been redeemed. I firmly believe these people existed, and they were chosen and highlighted to emphasize this overarching theme.  
  
Certain parts of the Bible may make us uncomfortable, not because they advocate for wrongdoing, but because they acknowledge the reality that we all have the capacity to do wrong. It's crucial to recognize that we can be redeemed.  
  
Furthermore, if someone reads the Bible cover to cover with the intention of finding reasons to reinforce their preconceived biases, they will undoubtedly discover passages that align with their views. This is a common approach taken by many individuals. Personally, I prefer to read the Bible from a historical standpoint, aiming to understand how its original authors intended it to be interpreted. 'The Bible Project' is an excellent resource that accomplishes this effectively, which is why I highly recommend it.

I don't omit any parts of the Bible; however, passages are often misused to cater to people's biases, leading to interpretations that can be transphobic or homophobic. It's not that the Bible explicitly addresses these issues; rather, individuals project their own desires onto the text. By examining the historical context and translations, a clearer narrative emerges, which people often choose to overlook in favor of a more comfortable interpretation that aligns with their own beliefs  


For many years, I identified as an atheist due to witnessing people's misguided interpretations. I used to view belief in God as an impossibility, considering it something only naïve individuals would embrace. However, over time, I gradually recognized the obvious truth that had been present all along. Not believing in God requires far more scientific leaps than embracing belief in a higher power. Moreover, I came to understand that morality is real and disregarding it leads to measurable problems.  
  
Faced with this realization, I found myself at a crossroads: either to be dishonest or to choose belief. Ultimately, I made the decision to embrace faith.I don’t get why you are blatantly ignoring trans woman (biological man) competing in woman’s sport.It was used as far back as the start of the 1900s I believe but yes I accept nowhere near as “mainstream”

I don’t think any right minded people are trying to normalise it in terms of every day use, just in the context of discussing trans views and issues and being clear about a cis person.

Don’t forget there’s extremes on both sides, and they are the views most likely to be seen in media because they get attention. There will be some extreme people on the “left” or trans side that want more use of cis in every day life but that’s not the norm, IMOWhen you or anyone would want to redefine a term or a societal norm is that not asking others to accommodate them or you? Obviously,to me at least,we would have to define accommodate.  If you mean not to hate,suppress,abuse,etc then ok. We can agree on that. If a person isn't harming anyone then let them be,even if they are a Nazi in beliefs. When they break the law or harass someone then by all means do what the law allows. 
If you mean to accommodate is about accepting,celebrating,or even being an ally then I can disagree. I don't have to accept anyone's ways or beliefs about themselves. I don't accept Atheists, Muslims,most Christians, etc,but I also don't harass them or hate them for their beliefs. Those beliefs about themselves,even as a transgender, doesn't make you a good moral person. 

Someone that believes in Jesus, doesn't make them a good person, unless you define believe as I do. Just because someone is for abortion doesn't make them a good and moral person. Same with LGBTQ, Muslims,Jews, Buddhist's,etc. 

Their actions do. I think we can agree on that. I can celebrate a good person,but not one just because they have a certain trait,such race, culture, religion or even sexual orientation. 

As too accommodating certain individuals. Maybe Spock said it best. The needs of many outweigh the needs of one. 
If we as a society are to accommodate everyone,where will it end? Does everyone get accommodations based on their wants?

This is not to say certain ones shouldn't be done. We have handicap parking spaces,bathrooms,etc. But we don't force people to accommodate all people. 

To say one last thing. This is a very difficult subject and should be taking seriously. It is not an easy thing to fix and change society. It's not that nothing should be done,but we shouldn't rush into it. 

Just stop the extremes from running the hen house and we will make the best choices so to speak.Agreed. But simply not complying with someone's request is not being rude and does not constitute intent to cause harm.>*"Not believing* ***that some conscious forcec rated this place*** *requires far more scientific leaps than embracing belief in a higher power."*

I fixed it for you. The problem Christians have is that they think their God is somehow the only candidate for who is responsible for the creation of this place. The only reason the Christian God is the most popular God is because it was forced down the throats of nations that all had their own, for the most part, peaceful pantheon of polytheistic gods. If you didn't forsake your Gods and take the knee to worship Christ, you were often tortured and killed. Such a wonderful legacy. Funny, that the "true" God couldn't get his message across peacefully when they were just getting started.

The Christian version of the, "creator" was only able to spread his message of creation to the entire world through bloodshed, force, and coercion, and that without it most of the nations would have never accepted Christian Monotheism, as they had their own religion already.

It's not really a choice to take the knee when the only other option is suffering and death.

"*I don't omit any parts of the Bible; however, passages are often misused to cater to people's biases,"*

I was a full on believer when I did all my Bible studies over 15 years ago.

*"Certain parts of the Bible may make us uncomfortable, not because they advocate for wrongdoing, but because they acknowledge the reality that we all have the capacity to do wrong."*

God himself and God's chosen have a responsibility to do better than the average person. Exponentially so. The things you call, "mistakes" typically had the full approval of Jehovah, so it seems like now you're calling your god imperfect and prone to bad decisions, which is exactly the reason why, even if he existed, I'd never worship him.I'm not ignoring it, we don't know the extent of HRT on how it changes someone's body and even if we did, people's bodies react differently.

We can have that discussion without invalidating trans women.>as far back as

Apparently it entered into “common use” by [2011](https://www.etymonline.com/word/cisgender)

>i don’t think any right minded people

That’s true, most people probably won’t find themselves using or advocating for the usage of “cisgender” or w/e neologism as a casual term unless they’re otherwise pressured to, but the people who are hostile seem to be hostile to the implication that it should even be used at all. Of course, in scientific contexts, it makes sense to make the explicit distinction between trans and cisgenders. But beyond that, the absence of the term “trans” is presumably enough to indicate “cisgender”Specifically, by "accommodations," I am referring to the simple act of not misgendering people. I don't ask to be celebrated; in fact, excessive celebration can sometimes feel patronizing. I believe it is possible to have meaningful discussions about topics such as bathrooms and sports, but those conversations can only be constructive if approached without the preconceived notion that "these people are delusional idiots." That's the main point I wanted to convey.  
Furthermore, I want to emphasize that I cannot control the actions of other transgender individuals any more than you can stop Ben Shapiro from misgendering every trans person he discusses. Being transgender is no different from race or sexuality; it is simply a fundamental aspect of who I am. The actions of activists within the transgender community do not necessarily reflect the beliefs or experiences of all trans people, including myself.If someone doesn't like rape jokes because of trauma and such and you make rape jokes around them, that would be harassment.

If someone wants you to call them by a certain name and you refuse to call them by that name, you are harassing them.As a Christian, I choose not to address other concepts of God since I consider them inaccurate interpretations.  
  
Labeling all polytheistic gods as peaceful is biased, as many of these religions did have deities associated with wrath, war, and sacrifice. Referring to them as peaceful is misleading.  
  
It seems from your comments that you may not be well-acquainted with the Bible, and I find doubts arising about your familiarity with its content, including reading it cover to cover.  
  
There are indeed verses in the Bible promoting peace, such as Peter 3:9, Proverbs 3:29, Proverbs 3:31, Psalms 11:5, Titus 3:2, and Matthew 5:38-39.  


Can you blame Christianity for people claiming to be Christian but acting contrary to the teachings of the text? Or does it make more sense to blame the rulers of the time who were often inbred and mentally unwell, and would typically instruct their people to engage in harmful actions?  


You also assert that these places would never have accepted Christianity if it hadn't been forced on them. However, Christianity has managed to spread and persist in regions outside of its origins, such as Asia, despite facing persecution and being illegal in places like North Korea. People there still practice Christianity and even risk their lives for their faith. Furthermore, throughout history, being a Christian was often more likely to result in persecution and death rather than gaining power. Therefore, your theory that Christianity relied solely on force and coercion loses credibility in light of these facts.  


Your previous response raises doubts about your credibility regarding your understanding of the Bible's purpose, or perhaps you may have a limited understanding of history. In the Bible, even Moses himself expresses self-doubt and considers himself unworthy of being chosen.  
  
The significance of Christianity lies in the belief that everyone has the presence of God within them (Luke 17:21, John 14:16-17) and is deserving of redemption. This framing emphasizes the importance of human worth and the potential for spiritual transformation.  
  
It appears that you may prefer a God who imposes His will upon people, whereas I appreciate the gift of free will that I believe we have been blessed with, despite the fact that it can be used in negative ways. This may indicate a fundamental difference between our perspectives.there are "science" backing either point of view, so I won't say I know which is which.   
all I am saying is that when women repeatedly see an average performing male athlete, transitions, and immediately dominate competitions after competitions, women get pissed.  
.  
I still remember the "ironic joke" about Caitlyn Jenner was that the moment she transitioned, she's woman of the year surpassing all women immediately; the follow up joke was "it took a man to be a woman of the year".   


That'd piss me off too honestly if I was a woman and worked hard for female representation.

  
Also, I think it was this sub? Remember someone (big) from the lesbian community posted that they can no longer have lesbian/women only events now purely because they'd get hate on. All of these contribute to trans hating.   
Just trying to answer original question: why people are increasingly annoyed at trans ideology because it's leaking into every other thing in society. 

NOT trying to argue what's right or wrong.Yea I think I’m in agreement with you thereI can't even Imagine how you feel when you are misgendered. Not any more than you can feel what it is like to be called gay or other such slurs, although maybe you do,but this was a child. That's what children do,no matter how old they are. 

So you are asking to be accommodated by others not hurting your feelings in this way? I can this I'm a relationship or with family,but strangers? 
I'm all for asking for it,but to expect others to accommodate your feelings is asking a lot. 

I grew up with a lot of religious persecutions until I was about 13. To think that I would now,as an adult,ask or demand others to not persecute me seems a bit much. 

I just see that others are mostly cruel people and the only one I can change is me. Those that do that to you and others live in a different reality. One of hate, confusion and probably spite for what they don't understand. 

I'm all for it stopping and it is wrong. We should be able to have decent dialogue,like I hope we are having,but I guess I don't expect it from people. I hope,but don't expect anything

Unfortunately you,as you probably know,will get hurt. There are extremes on both sides. 

I do appreciate your courage and wish you the best. We can disagree on things,even lifestyles so to speak or how anyone identifies,but we can at least have a good and hopefully open conversation.If my anorexic cousin insists that I call her fat I am not obliged to follow her command about her sincerely held belief about herself. In fact to do so would be, IMO, more damaging to do so. 

Being raped is an objective physical thing that has or has not happened. 

I may call you by your name or I may not. But I will not affirm what I believe to be a lie, which is that you cannot become the gender or sex you believe yourself to be divorced from your biology. 

Sticking to that principle is not harassment. 

Now if I follow you around and won't stop talking to you, that is harassment. But not affirming your self perception is never harassment.>*There are indeed verses in the Bible promoting peace, such as Peter 3:9, Proverbs 3:29, Proverbs 3:31, Psalms 11:5, Titus 3:2, and Matthew 5:38-39.*

I've not (yet) said anything negative about the New Testament. I actually like Jesus. And even a villainous being will promote peace when it serves him. Why wouldn't they? Villainy isn't about making everyone suffer all the time, it's about getting what you want. Peace is less messy than war, even for "evil" people, and is the chosen route whenever possible.

*"Therefore, your theory that Christianity relied solely on force and coercion loses credibility in light of these facts."*

I never suggested it wouldn't exist \*entirely\*, I rather suggested it wouldn't be the global power it is. (It would not be \*dominant\*) The reason it IS so wealthy, so powerful and so influential is because it's an assertive religion. It historically either coerces or proselytes people into its belief system.

*"Labeling all polytheistic gods as peaceful is biased."*

I did not say that. I said, "for the most part." Please read carefully. Choice of words matters. I'm well aware polytheism isn't by default always peaceful, but **\*by far\*** it's track record is far more peaceful than monotheism. History demonstrates this, easily. Let's not miss the forest for the trees, here.

*"As a Christian, I choose not to address other concepts of God since I consider them inaccurate interpretations."*

You have no way of proving to yourself or to anyone else this is nothing more than psychological conditioning. Muslims say the same thing about Allah. Jews say the same thing about Jehovah. Christians on this very forum would disagree with your personalized, "accurate" interpretation of the God, just as I do, and I'm not even a Christian.

To claim you're more dialed into the nature of God, that it IS the same God the church worships, but that you know better than the church what the nature of that god is (and that the actual leaders of church are wrong) is the height of arrogance. It's once thing to say, "I reject the tecachings of the church." It's quite another to say, "I embrace the teachings of the church, except in the places where I know they got it wrong, and I know better than the men who lead the church I believe in."

I am also curious if you think you think gender exists in heaven, and how that relates to you personally.>all I am saying is that when women repeatedly see an average performing male athlete, transitions, and immediately dominate competitions after competitions, women get pissed.

No trans athlete who won in any women's competition started off as an average male athlete.

>I still remember the "ironic joke" about Caitlyn Jenner was that the moment she transitioned, she's woman of the year surpassing all women immediately; the follow up joke was "it took a man to be a woman of the year".

She faced a ton of backlash, but i don't think she should've been woman of the year, not because she's not a woman (she is), but because she literally killed someone.

>Remember someone (big) from the lesbian community posted that they can no longer have lesbian/women only events now purely because they'd get hate on. All of these contribute to trans hating.

If there was a "whites only" event, pretty sure it would get hate on as well.

>why people are increasingly annoyed at trans ideology because it's leaking into every other thing in society.

It is not, people make up pretend scenarios and fight against strawmen.

The same issue with trans women was with intersex women, there were "whites only" lesbian events that were hated on in the past, etc.I appreciate the civil tone of our conversation, and I sincerely wish you nothing but the best as well.You seem to make unfounded accusations without a thorough understanding of the Bible. It appears evident that you haven't taken the time to read it even once. In contrast, I have conversed with atheists who possess a much greater depth of knowledge on the subject than you do. Initially, I responded because I genuinely believed you wanted to learn more about it. However, I now realize that you are unable to listen without allowing your biases to interfere.  
  
I hope that someday you reach a point in your life where you can approach the text with an open and honest perspective. Unfortunately, it seems that isn't currently a possibility. Wishing you a pleasant day.Well thanks. I have some things to learn,even if I disagree with them in the end. At least I can see it from your POV or others. Doesn't have to be about this subject.*"It appears evident that you haven't taken the time to read it even once."*

If the only way you can satisfy yourself relative to this debate is to create lies about me, it really demonstrates to me how flimsy your position is.

Rather than retort with facts and ideas, you're now cowering behind the, "I thought I could debate with you, but you're clearly closed minded" excuse. There is no reason I should tolerate your bullshit baseless accusations against me.

If you really cared, you'd point out where my ideas are unfounded. Because I've made a solid case, and I've made retorting difficult to do, you've shown yourself the back door. I debate many subjects, not just religion. I know exactly what is happening right now, and why it is happening. You choosing   to make the conversation about \*me\* rather than arguing ideas only to bugger off after tossing your daggers would only surprise me if I hadn't seen it thousands of times in my life already.

It is also, for what it's worth, completely the opposite of what Jesus would do. You've made up unfounded lies in your head about me and then have spoken them publicly as if they are true... and yet you claim to follow Jesus?

If a benevolent god DOES exist, he would never wish his followers to experience the cognitive compartmentalization you have demonstrated in this conversation. To stand up for what is right \*in spite\* of what other beings with power tell us is right is the highest form of morality \*and\* spirituality, and this includes standing up to tyrannical beings like Jehovah masquerading as the one-true-god.

Because I don't know if I'll hear back from you, I'll just say honestly that I have gotten the knowledge that I needed from this conversation. Because I consider the trans-movement to be one of specific kinds of mental comparmentalization, it doesn't surprise me that you have approached the Bible with the same kind of psychological mental compartmenalization. Nature is full of observable patterns, after all.

You strike me as someone trying to be a good person, but from my vantage point, your mind resembles a pretzel.JBP's haters are transcentric TORAsI recently discovered that mentioning Jordan Peterson outside of this subreddit in a positive light results in the post or comment being downvoted like crazy. I discovered the problem by mentioning him on a reddit post made by a man who dislikes the current work and dating situation. I brought up how Jordan says that men make less money on average than women if they work the same job, which makes it hard for a man to find a woman because women tend to like successful men. I also brought up how Jordan has lots of compassion for men in that situation. Well, my comment got downvoted and a first I thought it was how I worded it but eventually I discovered **ANYONE who mentions Jordan Peterson in a positive light outside this subreddit gets downvoted.** The most ridiculous part I discovered was that some of the people downvoting my comment and other comments and posts is that many of the people replying agree with many of Jordan's points and yet dislike Jordan. 

After a quick Google search I discovered the reason he is hated in some communities is because he is considered a "transphobe." Many people here on Reddit and elsewhere such as Medium think Jordan is dangerous and shouldn't be allowed to speak his mind because of his "transphobia." Some of those people even said that they would be for firing a scientist who they know is about develop a cure for all cancers if they are known to make "transphobic" comments! I was shocked, because that means their entire worldview revolves around transgenders. Jordan is not "transphobic," but those that think he should be de-platformed are transcentric, which means they think the world revolves around transgenders when it does not. Next time someone calls me a "transphobe" for questioning trans ideology I will simply call them transcentric or a transcentrist. The next time they refer to Jordan Peterson and his fans as "TERFs" or Trans Exclusive Radical Feminists, I will simply call them "TORAs" or Trans Obsessive Radical Activists. Those are both terms I thought up after discovering just how much some people think the world should revolve around transgenders.

I had to vent and get this off my chest because I was disturbed to learn just how much some people think the world should revolve around transgenderism as if it is a religion. I had to fight back the best I know how and I think if we are to win we this fight against radical transgenderism, we are going to need catchy terms of our own. I think "transcentric" and "TORA" are perfect for that. I am really sick of the one-dimensional assessment these people make based simply on whether or not someone is a "transphobe." It has to stop.Good luck getting that karma back.I don't think naming your opposition with a pejorative that sounds like the holy book of a religious group is the optics win you think it is. 

Unless this is an op. 3 to 1 odds this is an op.I just call them gender ideologues.

I think that highlights the faith-based and cult-like aspects of their belief system while also denying them the satisfaction of being referred to as "activists" or "advocates"“as if it is a religion” which is exactly the reason why people refer to it as an “”ideology”” or a “”cult””i think it says alot about our current state of society if a Credited PSYCHOLOGIST can’t even discuss what he considers a serious issue of the mind. I thought opposing schools of thought were a thing? It’s literally his job/passion to help people. A little about myself and to eliminate excuse for simple dismissal i’m not conservative, im not even religious/spiritual. I dislike and am not convinced by faith based arguments. I am a free thinker and if i had to pick a party-.-, a libertarian . As much as i love people’s freedoms and liberties i do also believe we have to draw boundaries at some point. Personally i find his interviews insightful, not hateful. Especially the ones that were banned/censored. JP selects multiple people and allows them to speak up so they can be heard on said platform and help others. Just because you don’t like his assessment of the situation or his stance on this topic doesn’t mean he’s automatically wrong.

i have heard him talk to detransitioners such as [Chloe Cole](https://youtube.com/watch?v=6O3MzPeomqs&feature=share8)

This video is hard to watch but she deserves to have her story told.

transcare specialists like [Sarah Stockton](https://youtube.com/watch?v=pCH-bUFR3WM&feature=share8)

why would she change her mind if there is nothing wrong? will she be written off or simply dismissed now?

He literally gives them opportunities to say what they want/ need to say. Yet people seem to find endless excuses as to why he shouldn’t have a platform, I personally feel his demonization and  videos being taken down regardless of his expertise in the field are unjust and absolutely shameful. Detransitioners should also have a voice, it’s like people can’t fathom the thought that there actually might be more detransitioners than they thought. Silencing people over fear of you being wrong on something you supported is not okay . I find it extremely worrisome that people don’t realize how bad this has gotten. I spent hours of my day listening to this man speak, remember when JP was brought onto canadian news to discuss with other people the controversy over required pronoun usage?A Guest literally didn’t want to discuss/debate him because “Giving Peterson this platform serves to legitimize his views which are based in bigotry and misinformation.”which strikes me as a lazy and easy cop out. To me this is a blatant attempt to discredit Jordan and suggest that even debating him on this topic shouldn’t be done.i recommend watching the whole thing though if you are pressed on time and just want evidence of this skip to [42:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=kasiov0ytEc&feature=share8)(so much for open discourse) I followed up to see if anyone was going to debate him as he was supposed to go to a university i believe. i then found and watched said video, at one point one of the people debating against peterson was opening up with a quote from an unrelated debate. “I do not want to be here, i do not want to dignify this man and his ideas in public debate”. This does not encourage discourse, this is an attempt to demonize your opponent, i was not a fan of this approach during the debate. I also recommend watching the whole thing, or  [44:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=ZCzKpz7Lm2U&feature=share8) if you just want evidence of this moment.

Although i don’t agree with the solution suggested in op’s post,  i agree with op on the fact that this is getting out of hand and the freedom to exchange ideas and thoughts is diminishing. This is not a good thing. i do believe that, given the circumstances “the pendulum will swing back”and it’s going to swing HARD. it’s already happening in other parts of the world.Hey, Peterson hater here. Firstly I want to say I disagree with deplatforming literally anyone except for like actual terrorists and people making explicit calls for violence or criminal acts. Also, I personally think most of his self-help stuff is good (although usually a little nebulous and up for interpretation). As for why people don’t like him outside of this sub, well there’s a lot of reasons. I can give you a few of mine.

1. He acts and his fans treat him as if he is the calm, logical and reasonable pundit, when on multiple occasions, when a point is made against him, he’ll get triggered, start speaking more aggressively and making emotional appeals as to why the other person is wrong. Such as “we’re butchering children!” Essentially just a right wing virtue signal.

2. Every time a logical inconsistency he has is questioned, the response is always “well, that’s interesting, but have you seen *all* of my gazillionjazillion lectures? You wouldn’t be saying that if you had”

3. He’s very eager to box *anyone* who opposes his opinions as “postmodernist neomarxists” (which are contradictory ideologies btw, I’m guessing with this he’s trying to say that they have conflicting morals?) and almost never interprets anything they have to say in good faith. As well as being awfully abrasive and cruel in his language when he’s talking about them (never to their face)

4. His rhetorical strategy to give himself plausible deniability is to almost always make descriptive statements and never prescriptive ones. It’s always “This is happening” “This is bad”, which is almost never followed with “thus, given that it is happening and it is bad, we must do this” leading his fans to fill in the blanks in any way they want.

5. His cherry picking as it relates to trans issues is so incredibly obvious once you have actually read the studies and heard out the other side. You know he’s being desperate when he has to resort to using the Swedish Study or studies which talk about GID instead of GD.

I never saw these problems until a couple months ago when I actually was a Peterson fan myself and started engaging more critically with his content rather than taking everything he says to be true because he uses big words and sounds educated. If you guys are interested in more criticisms beyond the surface level “He’s transphobic!1!1”. Feel free to hop over to [this sub](https://reddit.com/r/Destiny) and ask. You’ll get lots of reasonable critiques.I call them NPCs, since they don't have a mind of their own and just think and do whatever the legacy media tells them, even when it contradicts what they were told the week before. They all believe the same things and they're all Progressives. It's a cult.Good analysis.  I think the impression has been intentionally created by tireless influencers and wannabe influencers more than by genuine believers in that specific mind trait.Welcome to the jungle bud. I like the way you’re choosing to handle it.Calling hating JBP "wokeism" is a great example of how the right just uses that word to mean anything they disagree withI think “cisphobe” might work better.TERF just means Trans Exclusive Rational Female. Wear it as a badge of honor.Imagine crying this much over downvotes lmaoPeople complicate 'trans" with being ignorant or confused by the Paradoxicality of the Feminine-Masculine +/+-/- dynamics in Life.Alternatively, you could just suggest some of the reasonable positions expressed by Jordan, but don't bother mentioning where you got the idea, at least not until later when everyone is already aligned on the reasoning, then you're all, "Glad you liked it - that's another JP concept".Sorry, downvoting is activism now?See I really respected jbp as a fellow studier of abnormal psychology/neurology. And coming to the subreddit is what made me me lose it somewhat, realising pleas from people would go ignored etc like I’m sure he’s a busy man but hire an intern xD.Haters without reason are just idiots grouping aroung some shared topic-to-hate.Sacred caste is my favorite or trans supremacy as a second. But they call themselves sacred all the time. I have a bunch of images trans youth are sacred etc. Who calls themselves sacred? A cult.Downvotes happen all the time. People who criticize Peterson on here get downvoted into oblivion. That’s just how things work lol. I think Peterson uses pretty unfair and harsh rhetoric towards trans people, and he harps on them to such a degree that it seems like an obsession. I understand why people label him as transphobic. Overall I feel like both sides of the political aisle are trans centric at the moment.You should do some introspection if "discovering Jordan is unpopular on Reddit" has stressed you out to such a degree you have to vent about it and "get it off your chest" to others.Every single day on this sub multiple articles, news stories, and commentary on trans people and drag queens are posted. Every single day, to a sub that's supposed to be about a self-help personality and conservative commentator.

Ergo, the term Trans Obsessive Radical Activists would likely be applicable here too.Just got banned from posting on r/JusticeServed because of this comment lol.The Karma thing is the least of my worries actually. My main worry in this by far is that it appears the world has gone crazy to the point where many people think the world should revolve around transgenders.We need to start using the word "TORA" and "Transcentrist" or "Transphile" at them. I know they would hate it though, lol.Well it’s just completely out of control.  As you pointed out, if someone doesn’t say the world revolves around trans issues then you’re a transphobe? Really?  I call bullshit.  I’m not trans and I’m sure I will be downvoted and called a transphobe for even saying this but the world doesn’t revolve around my gender identity.  And if you want to say it does, I’m not demanding it of anyone.The terms are not meant for all people who agree with transgenderism but only those who are so obsessed with it that they want people who question it deplatformed.Well, I may very well change my term to "Trans Obsessive Radical Ideologist" or "TORI."Is he even a psychologist anymore? I think "conservative media personality" is a better label.I can respect you but that is because you are using logic and not simply being a reactionary. The people I am criticizing are the ones who are and have worldviews that revolve around trans issues.Even if these points were true they’re actually really weak reasons to “hate” someone, especially someone who’s reached his level of achievements. None of them are tangible reasons. It’s better to just admit he doesn’t align with your political views. 

Like the topics he discusses actually do require an understanding of history and previous philosophies / studies, and those are shared in his lectures. Seems completely reasonable he’d ask if you knew what he’s talking about. 

And perhaps you missed his book literally called 12 Rules for life which was entirely “prescriptive” with concrete actions on how to improve one’s life. I don’t think he’d be around still if he was speaking without substance. 

So you don’t think his lectures are worth watching, you’re unaware of his book…. Did you take in any of his work besides Twitter and YouTube shorts? What was the content you engage with more critically? LolAnd I am sick of it. I am a biomedical student who is passionate about science. Science and censorship do not mix so I see this ideology as a huge threat, especially since not only is it bad science, it is bad philosophy. No philosophy journal will allow circular arguments and yet a woman is defined by gender studies as a person who identifies as a woman. Dictionaries, at least traditionally, do not allow the definition of a word to include the word itself. Again, I am just sick of the whole thing.I can tell you don't like JBP and I assume your reason for disliking the guy has to do with the trans issue. I can respect people not liking the guy, but most people I have seen that don't like him dislike him because of the trans issue despite agreeing with him on certain things, and of those most think he should be deplatformed. Those people are TORAs aka trans obsessive radical activists. They are also transcentric because their world revolves round transgenders. Trans people are their god.The problem is that would acknowledge "cisgender" as a legitimate word. "Cisgender" is not a legitimate word because it simply means anyone who isn't trans, aka normal people.True but the very term ‘cis’ is so revoltingYou can wear it as a badge of honor and still use the word "TORA." I would rather be a TERF than a TORA.People have done that with Donald Trump in 2016 by saying the idea was from Hillary Clinton and which lead them to agree with it and then reveal that it was actually a Trump idea.No, it isn't the downvoting but what is motivating it. They are downvoting because they don't think Jordan should be platformed, which they admitted to. If they are against platforming someone's comments on an issue unrelated to trans issues just because that person is a "transphobe," then I am sorry, but that means they are trans obsessed and are therefore transcentric and TORAs.Also, you obviously did not read my whole post. I said that the people in those other subreddits agreed with some of what Jordan said and yet downvote any positive mention of him because of what he says about trans people. Jordan never said he wants anything to happen to trans people, so if they dislike him that much because of his stance on trans issues, that seems a bit one-dimensional does it not? Doesn't it seem a bit trans obsessed, since neither I nor the others mentioning him even mentioned the trans issue? Either you did not read the whole post, or you are a TORA and a transcentrist.I too have compassion for trans people, just like I do for all other mentally ill people. In fact, I suffer from a mental illness myself, so don't give me this crap about not having compassion for trans people.High profile scientists get lots of emails, to the point where they almost never respond. I  have sent 3 scientists including JBP emails and not a single one responded. It is normal and acceptable for them to ignore your email when they get literally thousands of emails per day.Well would you know it, another TORA just outed himself.Well, for a scientifically minded person, it is disturbing to see that many people's world revolves around something as anti-science as transgenderism. I mean come on! How many TORAs are there out there?This post? You mean you tried to crosspost this to there?They must have extended their auto ban beyond r/conservative, this is a daily occurrence there.It’s the new civil rights frontier to them. Except they don’t realize they went past the frontier and over a cliff. They kept looking for more oppressed groups to defend, ran out, and found a group of people with mental illness instead. But they don’t help them, they tell them their mental illness is just another way to be, and it’s such an absurd claim that of course it becomes a toxic debate almost immediately. They can’t defend it on its merits, so they have to attack the reputations, motivations, and character of the people that disagree with them.As much as I understand the point you're making, I have to disagree this will help the situation. The left doesn't use the word, "Transphobe" in any realistic way. It's meant to be an attack on someone's character, and has essentially been reduced to colloquial slang. A, "phobia" means you're afraid of something. Last I checked, we're mostly on the side willing to talk about anything, while the other side refuses to even speak with us half the time and wishes us censored.

THEY are the phobic ones. They fear our opinions, they fear our fearlessness. No question about it, but using words that aren't meant to be derogatory but still have colloquially become so will just add gas to an already raging fire.Sorry, what do you mean "agree with transgenderism"?Yes he is still a psychologist. Unfortunately In 2016/2017 He suspended his private clinical practice and said his notoriety made it ethically impossible to continue. Understandable, i mean i can only imagine how many messages and emails he gets to this day.Personally i won’t downplay the fact he studied hard , taught, and helped many people throughout his years. It’s no small feat to get that license.He still has years of experience and knowledge under his belt and nobody can take that from him. I would consider him a psychologist whom also does social and political commentary. That being said i suppose i can’t really blame you for throwing conservative in there given some of his views and how people, at least in America, tend to associate opinions on matters with a political party instead of it being an opinion of an individual. I personally despise political parties, as did George Washington. Hopefully one day we will move past this modern day tribalism. Though i doubt it.Well I don’t actually hate him, the OP referred to everyone that disagrees as haters so I just went with it.
I am aware of his book, I’ve read some of it, it was pretty ok. However, that book falls more into the self-help category, which I mentioned was pretty good in the first paragraph before I gave my reasons. Clearly there I was referring to his political work.

The problem with the “have you seen *all” my lectures?” Is he always says that as a way to dismiss the other person’s arguments, for which, it is a weak response. It is completely unreasonable to expect that your opponent has seen all 150hrs+ on youtube and even more so, is able to recall exactly what you’re talking about and what you’ve said about it.

I did mostly engage with his youtube videos, a medium which he and his team have full control over and can edit out any parts that show his bad side. Also with videos of him at debates and certain interviews. I feel that if he’s so profound and such a good professor, he should be able to make his points there without appealing to his catalog of lectures, no?The ones creating the division among us want us as sick of it as they want the other side rabid toward us. It's an unfortunate reality we have to overcome on our own.Yeah, claiming that your an "obsessive radical activist" and that "trans people are your god" if your dedicating a lot of time and energy to defending trans people from the right is a dishonest framing of thingsYou probably support basic female rightsI feel most people don't want Jordan platformed for reasons extending far beyond just the trans issues. Though to focus on your trans issue claims; I think the way Jordan has handled trans issues does tend towards the same patterns of behaviour as say, right wing reactionaries. These patterns of behaviour may explicitly be shown in the discourse around trans issues, but they signal to a large audience that said individual is perhaps not worth listening to. In much the same way as you are calling people "TORA", people could look at you or Peterson and say, oh this dude is a right wing grifter and we should move on. They aren't obsessing over trans debate, they're using opinions on trans topics as a litmus test.I don’t think of myself as obsessed with transgender issues. I have opinions about trans issues of course, but there are plenty of other important issues going on politically that I think deserve attention too. Climate change is a big one, healthcare and how expensive important medications are, affordable housing, Republicans’ attacks on the electoral system, the weakening of things like child labor laws, the hugely unpopular scotus abortion ruling, etc. Backlash against trans people and attempts to prevent them from accessing the care they feel they need is quite bad too of course. But if you’re trying to say there are tons of people on the left who only talk about trans issues, that’s obviously not true. A ton of the talk about trans issues is coming from the right. Peterson himself is going bonkers on the Twitter timeline talking about trans people lol.How is that a new phenomenon to you??? You see that *rampantly* throughout everywhere in the world.Lol no, anyone who interacts with any post in this sub is automatically banned from posting JusticeServed. A simple comment is enough to trigger the bot. 

Source: I was also banned over this kind of thing. It also happens with other subs.That is another area I think conservatives get wrong. Young people need another frontier to fight for because simply holding your ground is boring. When they don't have something real to fight for, they fight for something fake like "trans rights." What I think we should do is fight for mental illness rights and better treatment of mental illnesses, which includes transgenders. As of now, the mentally ill are exploited by pharmaceutical companies, so that is one thing people could fight against.I don't think you really understand. The word "TORA" is not meant to shut people up but to shame them for shutting us up, because it means someone who is so obsessed with trans issues that they want to silence people like JBP.It's quite fascinating to me to how words are being bend so far from their original definitions sometimes, phobia also is a clinical term but some idiots just thought about putting a "social" section on Wikipedia and call it the golden standard now.People who agree with transgendersits activists that anyone who questions the ideology in any way should be deplatformed. If someone says men can't get pregnant, that person should be fired according to them. If you say you don't consider trans women to be real women but rather mentally ill men, you should be fired according to them.In the Cathy Newman video he defended everything he said without referring to his lectures.  Same with the first viral video of him engaging with students outside. He’s one of the most articulate people in mainstream media…… he rarely refers to his lectures in debate.That is why we are losing actually, which is why I said in a comment below that we can not simply hold ground but need a goal or cause to fight toward. Young people need a real frontier to fight for or else they will fight for something fake like trans ideology. My proposal is to have them fight against the abuse of mentally ill people, including transgenders, by big pharma. Big pharma exploits mentally ill children to make them transition and takes advantage of people with with certain mental illnesses by giving hem amphetamines basically. We can also push for more funding of research on these disorders for better treatment as well as investigations into big pharma cover-ups. Mentally ill people have long been exploited and mistreated, including being put in solitary confinement in a straight jacket.Well yes, there are people who consider him sexist and compare him to Andrew Tate which I really don't get. However, most people I have seen are admitting he is not sexist but they still say he is dangerous for his views on gender. I mean how gender obsessed does one have to be?I actually asked a person who downvoted my comment if a scientist should be fired if they are about to develop what most experts agree would be a cure for all cancers, but they are known to have made "transphobic" comments. The person said yes. If that isn't transcentric I don't know what is. I mean talk about a one-dimensional assessment!“I think the way Jordan has handled trans issues does tend towards the same patterns of behaviour as say, right wing reactionaries” 

What would be an appropriate way to handle the trans issue when you disagree with it?What is new to me is the sheer number of people who are not only obsessed with transgenders but so obsessed that they think people like Jordan should be deplatformed. I knew it was rampant but I didn't realize how rampant. I guess you could call my experience a rude awakening.There are plenty of fights to be had for young people—all people, really—but they involve difficult, disciplined, daily work, and mostly involve mundane issues like self-mastery, intellectual growth, financial security, supporting a family, taking ownership of one’s community and their place in it, basically ‘cleaning your room.’

It’s far more attractive to young people in the grip of a messianic complex to sit at home, indulge in whatever whim they can conjure, and convince themselves they are self-righteous by parroting simplistic, social justice nostrums on the internet while not doing any actual work.I fully understand. My response in a meme form:

"Tell me you want to start mimicing an attribute among the left that we hate without telling telling me you're going to start mimicing an attribute of the left that we hate."

My advice is the same: Don't become what you hate.What ideology? That being trans is fine?Again; these people are pointing to his views on gender as an indicator of larger problems with his rhetoric and behaviour.

To use an example I've seen a lot: "The way he treated Elliot Page is transphobic.", is a factually true statement. Peterson misgendered Elliot, refused to call him by his new name, and called the surgeon that performed the mastectomy a "criminal physician". Regardless of how you personally about the issue, these are transphobic comments. This blatant public transphobia is an indicator that perhaps Peterson does not meter himself well in public discourse, a behavioural trait he shares with known sexist and accused human trafficker Andrew Tate, as well as suspected domestic abuser Steven Crowder. The transphobic rhetoric is something else Peterson shares with these individuals.

These people aren't "obsessed with gender", they just don't want to hear Peterson's views because they think they will be bad talking points, in part because Peterson sucks at talking about gender issuesWill firing this scientist result in the cure for all cancer not existing? Because that doesn't feel very realistic. Why can someone else not carry on the research?Well what about it do you disagree with?What is API and how would a paywall help with this problem?I get called far right by people on the left since I support Trump and oppose trans ideology but I also get called a leftist for some of the unconventional things I support. I took JBP's personality test and I am 90th percentile in openness with low conscientiousness and low agreeableness. I think Trump has a lot to teach people on the right, and one of those things is people want something different, which is why he is so popular on the right. He does not simply want to hold ground but wants to progress forward like building a wall, creating the Abraham Accords, and passing the "Right to Try Act" for terminally ill patients. I am not saying that to endorse Trump even though I intend to vote for him but rather because I wish there were more people like him. We need more people who are creative and yet not woke like Trump, Jordan Peterson, and more recently Elon Musk.My thoughts exactly. It’s easy to preach, hard to actWhat you are talking about is **how** to fight which is a good thing to talk about. Self discipline is a very powerful tool for that. What I am saying is people need to know **what** to fight in addition to how.Part of my inspiration comes from calling people like Greta "alarmist." They called us "deniers" so we came up with a term for them. I do get what you are saying though.I view it less as “fighting fire with fire” and more as “memetic warfare”, in a sense. Short, catchy ideas that effectively convey the intent of the movement spread easier than having an argument with everyone all the time. Bows were less technologically advanced than muskets, but iirc, colonizers had a much harder time using muskets against bows, as muskets were less precise and took longer to reload. In the same way, it may be more polite to engage in a discussion with the opposition rather than using their tactics against them, but arguably less effective. esp since an argument goes nowhere most of the timeNo, not that trans is fine, but the ideology that you can't question a person's pronouns. Even if you agree that trans women are women and not men, wouldn't you support the right to question it for free speech?Which right do men have that women don't have?Some of the people I talked with though said they agree with Jordan's points on the issues with the dating situation and yet still downvoted my comment. That seems a bit transcentric if you ask me...I am talking hypothetical. I made that clear in my comment in the other subreddit and even after clarifying the person said something like "sometimes principals are more important than cures." Talk about transcentrism.I have the same qualms Jordan has about it. What has he said or done that makes you relate him to “right wing reactionaries”?API (application programming interface) is something bots require. Reddit is about to start charging for API access, so bots like the JusticeServed one are going to disappear unless people are willing to pay for them.It’s probable that you and I are very different people since (on Quora) I have been mistaken for a Leftists due to the Trump bashing (since I’m anti-Trump) and mistaken for a Trump supporter because of several Conservative positions that I hold. But I agree with you that there need to be more people like Dr. Peterson and Musk who offer a program beyond simply opposition to the Left. (Though I think Trump is the wrong guy for it.)“What to fight” honestly, there are so many day to day problems that are prime targets to eliminate, that i’m really doubting it’s a question of “”what”” to fight. Homelessness, hunger, political corruption [eg. lobbying], corporate greed [eg. big pharma], the list goes on. it’s just that fighting each of these things takes discipline and commitment. and why bother with either when there’s a new show on netflix to binge?I'd go a step further and ask "why are you questioning them?"

Because the utilitarian "best" outcome, that is, the one that maximizes human happiness, is to treat people with respect and acknowledge their self identity. What harm does it do you to be respectful of someone's gender?Many cultures as you know do not give the same legal rights to womenWell that brings me back to my initial statement. Is downvoting activism? Or do they just disagree with Peterson on a more fundamental level than the trans issue?I mean, sometimes principles *are* more important. I'd agree that perhaps not in this case. But let's say someone could cure all cancers but it results in the death of the five largest cities on earth (by population). Do you still continue with the research?Well, in no small part his opinion on trans people and their "spreading of an ideology". Trans isn't an ideology and the only ideology I see trans people spreading is "it's fine to be trans". There's also the wider "post modern neo marxist" or "cultural marxist" argument that is absolutely just a rehashing of the nazi/fascist "cultural bolshevik" talking point; i.e. the idea that "moral degeneracy" will lead to the corruption and ending of "the west".I like that idea actually. You made me think it is possible at least some of the downvotes I got for mentioning Jordan were from bots to manipulate public opinion.That tells me that a lot of the mods protesting are engaging in underhanded behavior with bots and manipulation of public opinion. I hear that despite subreddits going dark, the vast majority of reddit uses don't support it.JBP does talk about that actually. He mentions and praises Trump's positives that I mentioned, but also criticizes him for being too over-the-top with his name calling. He thinks DeSantis would be a good replacement but I think Musk is better.I learned from the left that the majority of people fighting for a cause do not need to do anything for it to work. The majority of them can simply protest and picket, and then retreat to go play video games or watch a Netflix show while a minority (people like us) can be serious and make real changes. All we have to look at is how most protesters on the left are lazy and irresponsible and yet they still make progress because a minority of people like Bill Gates do the heavy lifting.>acknowledge their self identity

What if they identify as something other than human like a wolf or bobcat? Should we still acknowledge their self identity?I asked them if it was the trans issue and they said yes. I am sue they disagree with other things he says, since even I don't agree with him 100 percent. The thing that really triggered them, in their own words, was the trans issue.That isn't really comparable because "transphobia" doesn't actually kill anyone. Also, I can not really say what should be done in your situation since the number of people who could be saved may very well outnumber the people killed. If it was the common cold then I would say it isn't worth it but in that case I am not sure. I guess if it would directly kill people I would say discontinue the research but if it would indirectly kill them by making a dictator angry and triggering a war I would still say go ahead with the cure.“the vast majority” i’d be interested to see some concrete stats on this. given the narrative surrounding the blackout, i would’ve assumed most people support it“and yet they still make progress” funny how people who do nothing can still successfully advance their movement, isn’t it? almost like they’re not the cause of the movement, but are simply sheep being herded into supporting itIf the evidence suggests that doing so would make them happy, why not?I don't live in Pakistan. If you do, that's your bag. I'm talking about first world countries, because I live in one of those. Which rights do men have that women don't? You haven't answered the question. I posit there aren't any. Feminism is a useless, hateful ideology, and I have no interest in it or its adherents.You asked every single person who downvoted you?What if the "transphobia" continues the culture war rhetoric around the world to the point we end up with several violent civil wars in developed countries around the world? Then has transphobia killed people?Transphobia does kill people, what are you talking about? There's whole ass countries that will execute their citizens if they find out they're trans. Do those just not count for some reason?I saw threads in "As Reddit" and elsewhere about the blackout that indicated approximately 85 percent of reddit uses were against it. The posts were downvoted to zero and most of the comments were negative.Its not a grassroots movement that's for sure. If anything it is a top down movement lead by multibillionaires.

Edit: and yes you are right that most people are sheep. It makes me sad actually.Up to what point should we respect their identity as a bobcat though? Should a doctor prescribing medications give meds that are good for felines but harmful to humans if the person insists on cat medicine? Should they be allowed to go to a vet instead of a doctor and be at risk of being prescribed the wrong medication? If the person is partaking in a clinical trial, should researchers acknowledge acknowledge that it is a person they are dealing with or should they list the person as a bobcat, which could skew results of which side effects are likely to occur? Science and objective reality do matter sometimes.>*To use an example I've seen a lot: "The way he treated Elliot Page is transphobic.", is a factually true statement. Peterson misgendered Elliot, refused to call him by his new name, and called the surgeon that performed the mastectomy a "criminal physician". Regardless of how you personally about the issue, these are transphobic comments.*

[https://youtu.be/G2y8Sx4B2Sk](https://youtu.be/G2y8Sx4B2Sk)

Having an opinion doesn't make you a, "phobic."

Half the reason people like me can't take the SJW's seriously is because you toss that word around so much it's lost all meaning. Save your, "phobic" comments for people who actually are afraid of trans people. We're not. If we were, we'd be calling for censorship, which we're not. We'd be calling to deplatform people, which we're not. We're not afraid of discussing the issues with you. At all. In fact, most of us are EAGER to... which is literally the opposite of a phobia. Where does the left get off in labeling people Transphobic? It seems like an easy to to discredit someone's opinion without doing any legwork. It's lazy and ignorant at best, and insidiuous and evil at worst.

I'm well aware there ARE transphobes among the political right. They're idiots. But there's no shortage of idiots on both sides of the political spectrum, and Peterson has not once, at least in the hundreds of hours I've listened to him over the years, EVER made a "transphobic" comment.I mean, transphobia has already killed people. Trans people in North America are 4x more likely to be on the receiving end of violence, and there's still countries where you can be executed for being trans. It already is killing people.That falls into the indirect category though, since the research does not directly lead to a deadly war but rather the scientists "transphobic" comments are so triggering to some snowflakes that deadly war is the result. It is not the research that killed people but rather the war. It is not the research or the researcher that caused the war but rather the fact that some people are so thin-skinned that they became violent. I would say go ahead with the research.I’m wondering where they got their numbers from. I haven’t heard so much as a whisper about a poll on this until nowexactly. It’s almost pitiful to see all these people with inflated egos acting like they’re not being led by the exact people they claim to be fighting… but then those exact people act all smug and toxic and… it becomes harder to pity them…Up to the point it reduces harm. Like, I'm giving a very basic utilitarian impetus for recognizing gender identity. Which is, treating trans women like women, and treating trans men as men, in a social setting actively reduces depression and suicidal ideation in trans people. It literally makes them happier at next to no effort on your part, so why not do it?If your opinion is transphobic then yeah it absolutely makes you transphobic. Except when you mean the literal "fear" sense of phobia, in which case you are like 50 years late to that party. Xenophobia and homophobia have long dropped the "fearful" idea from their meanings.

Edit for a little more clarity. When you are called "transphobic" it's not that people actually think you are afraid of trans people. It's that they are saying you are using language that is discriminatory, denigrating, or otherwise disparaging of trans people on nothing but the grounds of their gender identity. People don't debate these ideas because we've frankly had those discussions. The evidence points to a utilitarian "best" outcome if you approach gender from the view of someone's self identity being valid. The evidence points to semantic shift further separating "sex" from "gender" which is something that happens all the time. Heck it took a semantic shift for "gender" to become synonymous with "sex". There's just no consistent logical argument that validates the transphobic view point, it's just bigotry, so why should we debate it?See you get it, but I don't think the guy I originally replied to fully comprehends that so we're trying to find a middle ground where we can agree on what exactly "harm" or "kill" mean.So where do you delineate between cause and effect?>*When you are called "transphobic" it's not that people actually think you are afraid of trans people. It's that they are saying you are using language that is discriminatory, denigrating, or otherwise disparaging of trans people on nothing but the grounds of their gender identity.*

So we agree, you've bastardized the word. Cool.

Also, you just throw around such derogatory terms so you don't have to engage people in their ideas. It's, "othering" the opposition and the oldest trick in the "Divide and conquer" book by those behind the curtain. Be de-humanizing your opponent with nonsnsical labels like transphobe and changing the meaning of words, you're giving yourselves your own justification why the other party isn't even worth engaging with. This is like, basic psychological warfare 101, and yall are falling for it.

It's deplorable.It is just like with my stance on abortion so I will use that analogy to demonstrate. I am against deliberately killing an unborn baby but I have no problem with premature delivery for medical emergencies, even though removing the baby \[alive\] can result in death and usually does if done before 16 weeks.I don't think you understand how semantic shift works.

Are you this particular about the terms xenophobic or homophobic?That's abortion though. Removing a fetus from the womb at 16 weeks **always** results in the death of the fetus. The shortest gestation of a viable human baby was 20 weeks and even then required intensive neonatal care. What you have just argued is you are against abortion except in cases of medical emergency. Which doesn't really answer my question of where do you draw the line between "actively killing" and "causing death".This isn't about, "Semantic shift" it's about knowingly reducing someone to an insult, because psychologically, doing so renders them unworthy of basic respect, which then in turn justifies you guys not even listening to their opinion.

*"Are you this particular about the terms xenophobic or homophobic?"*

Of course. People using words in incorrect ways is stupid. More than half the nation doesn't agree with how you throw about, "phobe." It's your favorite thing and requires no intellectual effort on your part at all.

Why have a well thought out opinion when you can get circle jerked by everyone just by calling someone a transphobe?Why shouldn't I use a term in a common way as short hand for the behaviour I outlined above? It's not a dismissal, it's a critique. The dismissal is because, as I said, the arguments used by bigots are always the same and have been debunked a thousand times.

If you don't like being called transphobic, don't act in a transphobic way. It's not difficult.Using negatively charged adjectives as a way to describe the behavior of others during a conversation is a nasty, nasty thing to do if the other person has only been arguing ideas and has not personally attacked anyone. People with integrity argue ideas, not the character of the other person.

Those that call others transphobes (or any insult) during a dialogue about ideas are among the lowest common demoninator of conversing humans. It's lazy, sloppy, and offensive. As, "idiot" is also an adjective, it should be clear why in the rules of engagement, we ought to refrain from attacking one another in this manner.

I will reiterate, the reason the left does this is because it reduces their opposition to a status they won't deem worthy of debate. Don't got a good answer for a question? "Doesn't matter, you're a transphobe and your opinion sucks." God forbid the left actually argue ideas instead of making their argument about the personality of their opposition. You really can't get more adolescent.

And ya see, you can't tell me this doesn't happen, because it literally happens all time. The reason I left the left in 2015 was because the climate got so bad, I couldn't have reasonable conversations any longer like I could with classic liberals. (And no, I'm not a conservative now. Fuck the two party system.)Sorry so I can't call your behaviour "transphobic" but you can call mine "lazy", "sloppy", "offensive", and "adolescent"? Transphobe is not directly an insult. It can be used as one, but as I explained above, it does also have the meaning of "bigotry against trans people". And calling someone's argument "bigoted" is absolutely fair critique. It means they are ignoring facts and reason to continue to push an idea they've already determined is right. "You're as stubborn as an ass", or "your arguments hold no water", would probably be good synonymic phrases here.

On the topic of insulting language; you are, quite literally trying to demean and belittle my argument to the point you don't have to engage with it. You are doing exactly and explicitly what you claim to dislike in a dialogue. Is "hypocritical" a word that is okay to use? After all, it has shifted greatly in meaning from the Greek "hypokrisis" or "coward" to mean something more akin to "self contradicting" or "behaving in a manner that projects qualities you do not actually possess".There's a fundamental difference between criticizing ideas, and criticizing people. One is direct. (I.E. that guy is a transphobe.) another requires the listener to identify with generalized criticism. (I.E. These are lazy ideas that only adolescents would argue.)

The former \*distracts\* from an argument and makes it about the insult, and the latter reinforces an argument by making connections beween an idea and behavior. When you call someone lazy, it does nothing useful. When you identify generalized lazy behavior, and give a reason why, you're now making progress and can help lead to a solution.

The whole point of my criticism is that people use, "transphobe" not to REINFORCE an argument, but to **replace** it. And that is indeed, lazy, sloppy, and adolescent.But if the argument is: "you spout transphobic rhetoric", which is the argument I've put forth here. How is that not critiquing the arguments made? I'm calling the actions transphobic, not the individual. You've shifted the goal from "transphobic isn't a word" to "transphobic isn't a valid critique"It's not shifting goals, they are separate critiques. 

Your colloquial use of, "phobic" doesn't translate well with the rest of us.

And in general, your culture throws around, "transphobe" in place of rational arguments far too often.

These are both valid critiques.As I've said though, you're half a century late to complain about the colloquial "phobic", and as I've shown with "hypocrisy", English appropriates Greek terms all the time and often without retaining the original meaning. So no that one isn't a valid critique.

And as I just explained, in this instance I am not using transphobic to refer to an individual, only their behaviour. So that critique, while valid to the wider left, isn't relevant to this discussion.I desperately wish I was a woman to the point where I constantly feel hopeless and miserable because of this. What can I do to manage this without transitioning? One reason why I haven’t taken steps to medically transition is because doing so would go against some of my more conservative views.I’m 21 years old, biologically male and desperately wish I was a woman. For the majority of my life I considered myself slightly conservative leaning and center right, and thus I’m pretty critical of the mainstream trans community. I feel like it’s very hard for me to fit in with them or relate to them as most trans people nowadays are far left and very progressive. I cannot describe how lonely this all feels. Most trans people want nothing to do with me as they consider me a “pick me” and have a completely different worldview than I do. On the other hand, the conservatives I talk to simply don’t understand what it’s like to struggle with one’s gender identity and know almost nothing about trans issues apart from what they hear from conservative commentators.

I can’t stand modern trans activism if I’m being honest. I believe there are only two genders. I think children should completely be left out of this in 99.99% of all cases and I hate how sexualized everything lgbt related has become. I especially feel embarrassed every time I see pride parades due to how sexualized they’ve become and how some participants bring their own kinks into it. I feel like people like me would be much more accepted by society if we just shut up and stopped rubbing all of this in everyone’s faces. I feel so embarrassed by how trans activists and the modern lgbt community act that I don’t even want to call myself transgender even though I technically am trans since I fulfill the criteria. I just don’t want to be associated with these people. What I find particularly bad is the way they can’t handle criticism. I’ve always been in favor of absolute freedom of speech so I find it very troubling how they’ve taken to silencing those who disagree with them by getting social media companies to ban content that they disagree with and use language as a tool to control others. I never understood the obsession the modern trans community has with language. I couldn’t care less about language or what pronouns someone uses to describe me. All of my gender-related misery and dysphoria are related to my own physical body and no amount of people addressing me with she/her will make me feel any better about it. 

I have never taken any estrogen and have tried to just live as a normal man. I sometimes dress in women’s clothes when I’m alone but whenever I’m around other people, I just try to act like a normal man. Admittedly, I do have long hair that’s styled in a pretty feminine way (bangs that cover my forehead) and one of my friends has said he’s too embarrassed to go to restaurants with me because “I look gay and feminine”, but I still present myself as male when I’m in public even if my style is more on the feminine side. 

I thought about getting a prescription for feminizing hormones and beginning a medical transition many times, but I’ve decided not to. Family has always been the number one most important thing in my life and I feel like transitioning would be at odds with that. I don’t want my family to have to deal with the shitshow that comes with trans healthcare and socially transitioning. I am self aware enough to understand it would make my parents feel worried, ashamed, sad and embarrassed even if they claimed to be accepting and supportive. I’ve also read about many people who went through medical transition and regretted it, and these stories are genuinely some of the most tragic experiences I’ve ever heard of. In addition, hrt and many of the surgeries are known to increase the risk of many serious health issues and even if you do everything according to the official guidelines and have a doctor monitoring your health, it can still seriously fuck up your body in ways that are irreversible. If you do this, you will essentially become a lifelong patient. Therefore, I have avoided medically transitioning until now.

The problem is that even though physically my body is now in perfect health, I feel absolutely miserable. I can’t help it, I just wish I was a normal woman so badly I can’t even put it into words. There have been many days when I’ve basically just lied in bed after coming home from work and cried because of how badly I wish I was female. I’ve had genuine suicidal thoughts over this. The only reason why I haven’t killed myself yet is that I love my parents and I don’t want them to have to deal with losing their son to suicide. I genuinely don’t know what to do. I’ll never be a woman and I’d rather die than be a man. I’m not going to end my life as long as my parents are alive but many days just feel unbearable. Right now I at least look like an unusually feminine boy who wears foundation so it’s still bearable to the point where I’m able to work and study, but I know it’s going to get a million times worse as I age and become more and more masculine looking. I would literally do anything to be a normal woman and have a normal female life (except for unethical things that harm other people or animals). I just feel like I can’t take it anymore and if this keeps up I feel like I’m seriously going to go insane and break. I don’t want to medically transition because of how many health risks come with it and how it would conflict with my desire to maintain good relations in my family and possibly start my own family some day. However, not medically transitioning also feels like a horrible choice as with each year when I’m not taking estrogen and testosterone blockers, my body becomes more and more masculine. I feel like the only “good” option I really have is to die, but I have to wait for my parents to die first before I can do that as I don’t want to cause them such grief and sadness. 

Anyone have any advice on what I should do? I’ve tried taking a break from social media, I’ve tried “embracing my masculinity” by doing stereotypically masculine things and going to the gym, I’ve tried just accepting it and moving on with life but I just can’t. None of those things helped and I just feel so miserable and I actually feel like it just keeps getting worse and worse. I can’t help it, I just want to be a woman and live a normal female life so so desperately that I’m legitimately just waiting to die at this point. I despise every masculine thing about my body and I feel so jealous when I go outside and see women who get to live life the way I wish I could live. I decided to ask here instead of on the trans subreddits for obvious reasons. Whenever I make posts like this on trans subreddits, everyone just tells me that I need to transition and nobody gives me any actual real advice that takes into account my actual circumstances. Even though I feel like I don’t really fit in with either the trans community or the conservative community, I still feel a little more at home with conservatives as they don’t ban me for my other political views. I value the same things in life as most other conservatives and generally share their worldview. The only thing that really sets me apart from the majority of them is the gender dysphoria I experience. The modern trans community on the other hand, has a completely different worldview than I do and their values go completely AGAINST my more traditional values. The only thing I have in common with them is the dysphoria I feel but apart from that, I could not feel more different than them. I’m looking for a solution to this which does not contradict with my conservative values and worldview and therefore transitioning isn’t an option. I’m sorry this post became so long, it just kind of felt like I needed to get this out of my system and writing it down helped me feel a little better. Sorry if this isn't the most fitting subreddit for this. I tried to post this on other conservative discussion subreddits first but for some reason my post kept getting removed so I'm posting this here as this is the only conservative leaning subreddit left that I know of that accepts text posts and not just news articles/memes.  Thank you for reading, I really appreciate it, sorry if this was weird but I genuinely don't know wtf to do with myselfYou just need to understand and accept the fact that you are a man, and nothing you ever do will make you a woman. You don't have to force yourself to do "traditionally masculine" behaviors. Just do the things you enjoy doing, don't care about what other people think about it. You don't have to be a woman to live the life you want to live, and you don't have to force yourself to do things you don't want to do to be a "real man".You might want to consider speaking with a professional therapist. Try not to take this the wrong way but gender dysphoria is in the DSM for a reason. It is indeed a mental illness that needs treated by a professional psychologist. And not one who thinks surgery is the first treatment.First: if you watch porn or any kind of hypersexualized material, stop. Also avoid communities which encourage or support transitioning. Think of it as a targeted cutoff.

Second: connected to the first, avoid losing testosterone via masturbation. Testosterone is very much a behavioral hormone, and an abundance/lack of it can and will change your behavior and emotions.First - It’s okay to be a feminine straight man. It’s okay to be a gay masculine man. It’s okay to be a gay feminine woman. Any combination is okay.

Second - We are finding that a large portion (over half) of trans are autistic and fixated on gender. Indicators point towards the number being much higher than that. Have you ever gone to a professional to diagnose or rule out autism as an influence? It may not help. It may give you a different perspective on the reason why you can’t stop thinking about this.

Clinical depression is a clear factor that often gets overlooked. I strongly suggest talking to a professional and making it clear that you are not looking for a push to transition, but a way to alleviate the symptoms and love yourself.It isn't an easy or popular choice, but perhaps the best way will be to find God. I cam testify that when I was at my lowest point and even contemplating ending things He helped me out of that. In the Bible it says if you do not know, then ask God, so my advice would be to just pray on it. Even if you don't want to read the Bible or join a church immediately, it is fine to start by just praying. I genuinely wish the best for you and hope that you can find hope and happiness for yourself. God bless you my brother.I genuinely hope that you can get past this without ending your life.

I think it's good that you consider the health risks of transitioning. And while I would agree that you shouldn't try to become female—because it's impossible, and for the health consequences you mentioned—I don't think you should make your decision based on how others will view it.

That said, if you believe that what you are experiencing is properly defined as gender dysphoria, I would suggest seeking out psychological/psychiatric help from someone who will not push for you to transition but will treat the dysphoria in a way that aligns with biological reality. Unfortunately I don't know that this will be easy to accomplish. I would probably my search with Christian or Jewish professionals, but that certainly won't guarantee that you find someone experienced in this area or that they won't be pushing for transition as even prominent Catholic hospitals are doing this now.Damn this shit is sad as hell. If you have conservative beliefs, keep them. I feel like you listed a bunch of societal factors keeping you from living your life in an honest and true way. Be your true self and only  medically transitions if you feel you have to. You can definitely transition without medical intervention.
But also, this is a Ben Shapiro subreddit, so you could be trolling lol either way, I hope for the best for you.>I’m looking for a solution to this which does not contradict with my conservative values and worldview and therefore transitioning isn’t an option.

You've written a manifesto about how you desperately want to transition but cannot because you consider yourself conservative. You've set invisible rules for yourself that don't exist because you've likely grown up thinking transitioning is only done by bad people. 

My suggestion is that if something makes you happy, do it. If wearing a dress outside makes you happy, go for it. If wearing makeup makes you happy, do it. Figure out what makes you happy without worrying if it fits a specific political mold.Unreal ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)https://www.thetrevorproject.org/People with depression are advised to get outside of themselves by helping others. You're seeking help for gender dsyphoria, not depression, but I think this advice could help you too. Helping others is good for your mental health in many ways. Volunteer at a food bank, foster kittens, teach English to refugees, be a "conversation buddy" at a nursing home, whatever resonates with you. And join a church, if you don't have one already. Being part of a community is also good for your mental health, and most churches offer opportunities for volunteering.

I'm so sorry you're going through this. Your post is very thoughtful. I agree with your decision not to transition. Don't let a therapist or actvists pressure you to change your mind.If you are willing to spend the money to transition, maybe try spending money on a therapist or psychologist and see how that helps. Explain your situation and see if there is some deep seeded issues from your past that is causing this......This is a shit place to come for the kind of advice. Go to therapy. I was in your shoes once and the only way I got out of it was realizing that regardless of how much I would spend on surgeries and the like I could never actually be a woman. The only reason I wanted to be a woman was to have children myself and that isn't a thing that is possible with today's science. Good luck. You are loved. Go to a proper therapist. Not some loser that only gender affirms youHow you feel inside is who you are regardless of how you look. I’m not saying you are a woman but kind of like a live your life how you want idea. I don’t understand how a man can for real want to be a woman when he genuinely has no idea what that means. I have no idea how being a man actually feels other than my observations so how could I want to be one? Maybe you’re just unhappy with things in general and think being a woman will fix everything but it won’t. I’m not trying to be mean or dismissive, just trying to give you another perspective.  For years we were taught that everyone is beautiful and that we should all accept ourselves for who we are. Now it’s the opposite in regards to gender. You are fine as you are and maybe the best way to help yourself is to take steps to love yourself. Men play an important role in the world, surely there is a place for you to fit. Sorry for the rambling. I can’t quite get out what I’m trying to say here but I wish you well.If you’re having suicidal thoughts for any reason, seek help to address those thoughts. If you don’t believe in hormone therapy, seek a therapist who shares this view and can help you navigate this healthily. The “right” thing to do is to get help so you stay healthy - anyone in this page encouraging anything else is misguiding you.Your best bet is to become a Liberal.If I may add to this...as a professional therapist..do look up a Trauma informed practitioner. Also, look into Intergrated Family System (IFS). Both these routes will go a long way towards helping you in your journey. 
Thank you for reaching out. It takes courage to speak up. I wish you the best of luck.This is good advice. Porn rots your mind and soul. It’s been all but banned here in Louisiana, I say good riddance.Thank you, I appreciate this kind of advice. I actually got a blood test done to check my testosterone levels a couple weeks ago but the results were completely normal for a 21 year old male so I don't think that's the problem. I don't really watch much hypersexualized content but I'll try to completely stay away from literally all sexual content for a while and see how that goes.Something to keep in mind with that: testosterone levels in general have been dropping, especially in first world countries. So I'd say take the number you received and compare that in that context.

Porn is one of the worst things in society. And the way it works on your brain effectively is a slippery slope. But we know the effects can be at least partially reversible via cutting it out completely.

Also, in general, find things you do like about yourself. Even if it's as simple as a game you're good at. That's a great thing to help with self esteem.Definitely nice to see a couple people being nice about this in here because the majority of this community just writes you off as severely mentally IllThank you, it's genuinely so nice to get advice like this for once instead of just the usual "transition now or else" commentsOp is severely mentally ill, but that’s not his fault and when we say “trans people are mentally ill” it’s not to make a dig at them. It’s to point out that they need help. Literally. 

If someone is schizophrenic or OCD, they are mentally ill. Gender dysphoria is a mental illness.You're welcome. I just try to always pass on what I've learned or experienced to anyone who may need it. To quote a show I watched as a kid: "Wisdom is a circle. What you recieve, you must give back."These feelings will not go away. They will get worse as you age. Masculinization will continue. Be horrified. Be afraid. Be depressed. But fucking do something instead of throwing your future away by repressing. Don’t become a John 50.I agree with you 100%. Honestly I don't understand why most trans people even get offended by this. Depressed people don't get offended when people call depression a mental illness. Nor do people who suffer from other such disorders. I have no trouble admitting that I am mentally ill and I wish society could accept that so that we could then start researching other treatments for it than just transitioning. I have a mental illness called gender dysphoria and I don't see how people saying I'm mentally ill because of that is offensive in any way.That does make complete sense. However the right seems to blur the lines by identifying mental illness and being out right hateful/transphobic without the empathy partI just want to find a way to make these feelings go away without transitioning. If I knew for certain that my transition would go well and that I'd be able to pass and live a normal female life at the end, I'd do it in a heartbeat without any hesitation at all. However, I'm really, really scared of something going wrong and all the possible medical complicationsI’m glad you feel that way. Because I definitely was not meaning to offend. So many of us are mentally ill, I have BPD- so when I feel emotions, I feel them 100%. Anger is rage, happiness is euphoria, and sadness is deep depression. There are mold stabilizers for it, but they seem to make me apathetic and I prefer to feel things, the good and the bad. So I just kinda live with it. 

Gender dysphoria has no treatment right now, aside from transitioning- which not everyone wants to do. I’m sure many more than just you want a way to love yourselves as who you are. I’m no psychiatrist, but I do know someone who was born male and struggled with what you’re describing. He got his hormones checked, they gave him something(can’t remember what, apologies) and he goes to therapy now and he now wants to live, thank God.I do sympathize. It’s terrifying, and it’s made so much worse by the uncertainty. To make yourself leave the uncomfortable safety of repressing to join a community where you will be made a stereotype, both in and out. you lose your invisibility, your shield. The unfortunate truth is that some of us don’t pass, and that there is currently no widely medically backed solution for dysphoria that doesn’t involve transition. From what you’ve described, you really don’t sound different from any of the rest of us. And like the rest of us, nothing else made it go away. I really hope you can realize someday that being a non-passing trans woman is not the worst fate you could endure. Life is filled with many pleasures, small and large, regardless of your decision in these matters. 

To actually answer the question posed in your post? I think you should find a hobby and/or engage in your current ones more deeply. Put this out of your mind as best you can, for a time. Let yourself be a person FIRST, and try also to see yourself that way. It seems you hold a lot of shame that clouds your self-perception. Transitioning won’t fix that for you - only you can.

Sorry for the essay. I hope life improves for you, one way or another.Yes fair, also remember that the next time anyone here says “the left” lolWell in the case of the left it is majority of the left, not just some.😂 so I’m left on just about every single metric and yet I agreed with your definition of trans folks being mentally Ill. But no you’re right not all conservatives think the same but all lefties think the same lmao come on now you know that’s bias and absurdNo. The majority(again not all, but most) of leftists I know think the same way, whereas when it comes to conservatives, it’s all different from one to the next.I am literally an example that disproves your bias notion but I understand you will continue to blanket the “left” (millions of people) in one category but refuse to do it to your own ideology for obvious reasonsI said majority. Majority does not mean all. One example does not disprove me saying “most”. Because I did not say “all”Trans people loreYooo is there a lore reason Benny Sheps is so obsessed with trans people? When are the writers gonna reveal the source of this fixation? I’m thinking we’ll get an episode that explains how Benny was in love with a trans man who broke his heart and betrayed his trust and that’s why he has a hot rage for trans folks. What do you think?He's' talked about this before - mainly its against mainstreaming a mental disorder. But it's now become about protecting children.I just wanna understand the characterOh awesome, protecting children. Can’t wait till he tackles gun control, since firearms are the leading cause of death among children in the US. Identifying as non binary is far less deadlyReally?  Protecting children?  How about we look toward every single medical and psychiatric association for medical guidance?    


"Nope!  Radio talking head is best I can do!"  


https://www.aclu.org/news/lgbtq-rights/doctors-agree-gender-affirming-care-is-life-saving-care>Periapsis

I referred to them as that word that one must not say on reddit lest you get bannedAnd for good reason. Equating the LGBTQ community to pedophiles is a good way to entice violence that might result in a lawsuit against Reddit.No one is inciting violence here. We are talking. If you choose to get violent because people are objecting to not leaving kids alone, well I don't know what to tell you.Liberal here. When Michael knows said that he wants to “eradicate transgenderism”, how exactly would he go about doing this?Edit: Michael *knowles

Okay, so I’m going to be charitable here and assume he means trans “ideology” not trans people. How would this work? Transgender people aren’t going to magically go away. It would be like saying “we need to eradicate gayness, but not gay people”: it just doesn’t make sense. I’m not trying to convince the people on here to support transgenderism, but just please recognize that it’s not something that can be eradicated; they’re here to stay.An -ism is an *ideology*, not a person. People with gender dysphoria need help, not coddling or affirmation that their illness is something to be celebrated. We don't do that with alcoholics, drug addicts, OCD sufferers, narcissists, psychopaths, sociopaths, etc. The ideology that it is a wonderful thing to be celebrated gets in the way of truly helping people who experience it.The first step is to stop indulging the nonsense that requires people to support Trans ideology. Second step is for LGBTQ people to leave everyone else alone. “Eliminating Transgenderism” is clearly a political statement, as opposed to other leftists who are openly calling for eradication of Republicans.I believe Knowles’ argument rests in rejecting the ideology insofar as society is no longer affirming the lie of transgenderism. Meaning it would no longer be an acceptable part of adult public life in a similar manner that walking around naked in public is generally not acceptable, or any other (albeit tragically decreasingly so) sexual fetish/perversion. Businesses and other institutions would cease their promotion of these behaviors and society would broadly look down on such.

For a comparison, as with many disordered behaviors, there are many people who struggled/struggle with same-sex attractions that do not engage in behavior that follows them. That doesn’t mean that they don’t still have temptations from time to time, but have enough discipline over the passions to recognize those temptations for what they are, disordered desires. I believe comparable approaches can be taken with gender dysphoria but recognizing the problem as a problem is the first and most important step. 

Someone struggling with their identity, whether it be on the basis of gender or otherwise, represents a psychological challenge for them. These people and their struggles do not disappear, however insofar as how society and its institutions help them, one thing it should not do is reinforce those delusions or encourage or promote perverse sexual fetishes, whether it’s someone who genuinely is confused about who they are and/or receives sexual gratification by crossdressing. Once society rejects transgenderism as something to be affirmed, it becomes all but “eradicated” in effect. The off person here and there espousing the falsehood would no longer be received as someone to be taken seriously from an intellectual position, but as someone that needs help. Leftists like to leap onto the shadows of interpretation because after all, if people suffering from gender dysphoria recognize themselves as actual people with a condition and not as “transgender,” you have effectively “eradicated” a group. But the only thing you’ve eradicated is their perspective on the matter (the ism), and the sleight of hand Leftist groups play is that they conflate the person with and reduce the person to the ism.Explain to me how all of a sudden 18 months ago it’s all about .01% of the population?Disingenuous OP. You can support transgender people that want to transition and be left alone. You can simultaneously want an end to the destructive lunacy impacting sports.I’m all for the middle eastern way. Pretty sure it’ll end fast. No one should have to pretend to be in the delusion  of the mentally I’llGet everyone to realize it's a mental illness that requires therapy and maybe psychological medication. Not puberty blockers, hormone replacement, and radical surgeries.I highly doubt that federal laws to eradicate transgenderism could be passed without violating the constitutionHow would you help people with gender dysphoria? It’s not like you can convince them that they are a different gender. People tried the same thing on gay people to “fix” them with conversion therapy, but it failed. The fact is that 99% of trans women/men are going to stay thinking they are women/men for the rest of their lives, and I don’t know how someone could change that belief.Okay well if the lgbtq leaves everyone alone then trans people will still be present in that community… not exactly the “complete eradication” that Knowles advocated for.

Also I want to know of the leftist politicians who want to kill republicans.Exactly. I say the same thing about the whole drag queen problem. Only a couple years ago no one cared about drag queens. Literally for decades and decades. It was bar culture. No one was forced to be able to watch it in anyway whatsoever. Then parents came out and started going to the school meetings and getting in trouble for disagreeing. The gay community didn’t like this, so a bunch of drag queens started to get in front of children. Then it got out of control and they started Twerking and the Twerking became even more sexual. It just got exponentially worse as the months and years went by. I think they know it got out of control, they just don’t want to admit it. But the weirdest part for me is how even moderate liberals won’t admit that there are 1000 videos out there of drag queens with BDSM clothing, barely anything on dancing in front of children’s faces. They just refuse to admit it.Do you think when knowles says he wants to "completely eradicate transgenderism" that means he supports some people transitioning? To me it sounds like he doesn't want anyone to transition, regardless if they aren't being destructive.That’s anti-freedom. People should not be persecuted for their identityThis right here is what he means. Murder and suppression of the out group. You would think Ben would know better, but apparently the grift and bigotry are too much of a draw.The people in blue states will never complyHe isn't saying he wants to try to change them. He's just saying they need mental help like so many other mental illnesses. For those rare few that are so mismatched in their bodies that therapy has no effect, surgery should be the next step.

No one cared much about genuine transgender people, the ones who have had the surgery, using the bathroom of their body type. People only started really getting upset when this ideology was foisted onto confused children by telling them if they don't feel comfortable in their body, they must be transgender, or if a girl is a tomboy, or if a boy is feminine. Used to be thats just how you were. Now everyone seems to want to convince the kids they need surgery to feel like themselves. And all a man has to do is say he feels like he's a woman, and he gets all the benefits that go along with that? He doesnt even have to have surgery. He can just walk into a locker room full of women and expose himself. The kinds of things lots of sick twisted individuals do to get their kicks. Their can be no prosecution of that simply because he stated he felt like a woman that day. No one really cared until the current ridiculousness started.>It’s not like you can convince them that they are a different gender.

Therapy.You are still conflating the desire to end trans ideology with eliminating a whole group of people - the desire is to end the ideology, which means people with gender dysphoria will still exist. I would like to see if you - as a good faith liberal - will refute this trans genocide nonsense.“To me” - Your anecdotal beliefs don’t change logic.

You can be against a greater ideology that seeks to subvert norms and still support those that go through the challenge of transitioning.

You have to be arguing in bad faith if you don’t understand Michael’s POV.

The youth should not be leaping to identify themselves to get in with peer groups. Finding out what your orientation and identity is should be a deeply personal thing. Influence from family and friends is showing in more than a handful of cases individuals that regret transitioning early. And the way the lobby tries to scrub those facts from discourse is incredibly dangerous.

You have “doctors” claiming hormone therapy can be reversed. It’s a lie, and should be considered malpractice. That isn’t how hormones work at all, and they know it. They receive $$$$$ for gender affirming care, and they know that too.Don’t listen to whoever this clown is.

Conservatives don’t want trans people to die, that’s horrific and goes against what conservatism stands for.If Knowles was only talking about kids, he should have specified. I don’t know why “complete eradication of transgenderism” wouldn’t also apply to adults too. In my opinion you’re being overly charitable.Again, people said the same with conversion therapy.I'm not saying he wants to kill all trans people. I'm saying I don't believe there is a way to end trans ideology while simultaneously letting people transition. I just don't really understand the difference, I'm honestly trying here.Yeah I know that this guy’s in the minority. Still bothers me seeing people support what Knowles said, as if being transgender is a belief system that you can just be talked out of.I'm sorry, my reply wasn't about what Knowles was saying, but about the what the person wrote in the reply to which you replied.Ok - a few anecdotes for context. Trans ideology is new. We had transexuals and transvestites (drag queens) for a long time and they were generally left alone, with the exception of occasional bullying - which is unacceptable. The bullying has now been flipped on its head to the point where we are requiring non-trans people to not only accept your transition but believe that a male is really a woman because he says so.  Trans ideology has nothing to do with their existence - it is the movement to force others to accept pronouns, boys in girls sports, boys in girls bathrooms, and transitioning children before those children are old enough to consent.  That movement and ideology has teeth and is using the power of government to deliver consequences to people who don’t conform.  The movement is also capturing private companies and enforcing their ideology in the workplace. My company - a large one - requires us to use whatever pronouns someone identifies with or we lose our job. Managers are encouraged to put pronouns in their email signature - and eventually, this will be required.  Trans ideology is about forcing people to conform - not about the existence of transgenders or transexuals.I wouldn’t call it a belief system. I think that there are people out there with gender dysphoria who genuinely need help. I pray for them because I truly want them to be happy.

The issue is that I don’t believe changing one’s gender is the solution here because studies have shown that suicide rates for people with gender dysphoria goes back up after surgery. I think that there needs to be an alternative solution presented and we should study how to help these people. I see the current path we’re on as problematic because it diverges from reality in that there are many inherent differences between men and women. We’re starting to see terms like birthing people, chest feeding, and more and i don’t believe that eroding the biological norms that we’ve followed for a millennia is the answer here. 

Something to consider is this: if a schizophrenic person explains their perceived reality, do we acknowledge that? No. I don’t believe that playing along with what people with gender dysphoria perceive as reality to be the answer to this issue. Does that help answer your question? I’d type more but I’m dealing with a bit of carpal tunnel…

Also OP I want to thank you for seeking out conservative opinions. I really enjoy engaging in civil discord with people across the aisle! In fact, one of my closest friends is a socialist and we get along great. We need more of this type of dialogue!This is probably one of the best descriptions I have ever seen. Couldn’t have said it better myself.Okay. 

I just wish knowles was more clear in his language because some right wing extremists could interpret it wrong, so it’s a bit irresponsible of him.I think eliminating transgenderism is pretty clearly referencing an ideology and not people; there is a clear misinformation campaign to misquote him to imply he meant something more nefarious.Anyone Familiar with Karlyn Borysenko?She's an odd one to me. She's an ex-leftist so to speak, where she's currently exposing all the crazy leftist stuff like their targeting of minors to become transgenders, socialism and what have you. I think she's doing some good as an internet activist. Why do I say she's odd? She apparently has a real hatred for almost every main commentator on the Daily Wire (alongside Charlie Kirk/TPUSA) besides Klavan (or maybe she doesn't like him too). Anyone notice this? But why does she hate DW? More simple than complex answer.

I'm only coming at this with a cursory observation, but she thinks Shapiro is an elitist asshole, Walsh and Knowles as truly anti-transgender, and Candace Owens as, I don't know, I guess Owens is "too much" for Borysenko's sensitive nature. 

I have issue with DW, but I'm not sure exactly what Borysenko thinks she's accomplishing when making vids dedicated to any DW drama i.e. ex-DW employee spills beans. Does she really think that the "exposure" of DW makes the non-prog side anymore stronger? It's already splintered as it is.She did this with Tim pool as well. I don't really watch her videos often because her voice annoys me.I was a fan and listened to some of her stuff. But, I think she does things to get attention.

She posted this: [https://twitter.com/DrKarlynB/status/1356603187998916610](https://twitter.com/DrKarlynB/status/1356603187998916610)

and I responded that you cannot use past trauma to excuse present poor behavior. I can't say "I was beaten as a child, therefore it's okay that I rob 7-11s." She promptly blocked me. So, I'm not impressed with her.It seems she wants to be seen as the only sane one who isn't on the whole prog bandwagon, scoping out who are the big players on the non-prog side and then saying that they're extreme or whatever. I wouldn't be surprised if she goes after, say, Coleman Hughes or James Lindsey who are arguably more to her liking on social issues. If so, that's a very, very lonely position to undertake.Hmmmm I read the tweet but I don't she's saying what you're saying, if I interpreted you correctly. From what I gather she's saying that mocking someone because "they deserved X or Y" because they believe that person is a "shitty person" is the same thing as saying a women deserves to be raped or sexually assaulted because she may be wearing a dress that's provocative. In other words she "was asking for it."Well, I didn't say she said anything.

She made a post criticizing people who mocked AOC for her alleged sexual assault in the past.

My point was that AOC was using that alleged assault to shield criticism of her accusation that two senators for murder and that we shouldn't simply accept AOC's word that she was assaulted.

I don't think that is an unreasonable position to take and, yet, she blocked me over it.

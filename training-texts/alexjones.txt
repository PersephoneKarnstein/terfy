It for wars, Tomorrow's news, today. Ultimately, those who are not vaccinated will end up paying the price. Remember everything with Joe Biden, everything with the globalist, everything with corporate media is an inversion of truth. Those who haven't taken the vaccine are going to pay for it. Now that's more than just a threat. It's an inversion of reality. Hey, it's not a vaccine. It is a experimental gene therapy that they studied previously in other trials on animals and humans in China, And it caused blood clots, It caused heart attacks, It caused the lungs to basically become bloody pulse. We have all the studies from the University of Texas And it now turns out hundreds of others. since the last few months, we began to show you the American Heart Association documents and UT documents and EU documents. that was back in December, six months ago. Hundreds of major studies have been pointed out that were there 20 years ago, 10 years ago, eight years ago, that this stuff is deadly. You could never create a coronavirus of SARS type vaccine, because it again attacks the proteins in your body, because the shell of the virus is made up of the same protein. you have a lot of your tissues, But that's settled science. He's saying: you're going to pay if you don't take it. Oh, so I won't be able to get cheap Yankees tickets, like they're saying, or I'll be segregated to the nosebleeds in a basketball game. I don't want to go to your stupid corporate garbage. The people paying are the ones that are taking these experimental shots that again aren't even vaccines And who, as they get sick and as they die, aren't going to be able to get any type of medical aid for the illnesses they have. This is the biggest scandal, not just in modern history but in world history, because we now know that they cooked it up in a lamp. We now know that they purposely released all the other shows, that we now know that they knew they had to have this type of virus out there so that they could tailor a vaccine during the hysteria to counter the spike protein which again actually causes the mass of illness. That's why it's now confirmed what scientists were saying three or four months ago in England and now in the US- people were taking these so-called vaccines, that the majority of people they were seeing in the hospital had been vaccinated months before with the so-called vaccine And they were having COVID-like symptoms of their lungs being eaten or massive blood clots. So this is a huge issue And I'm going to be covering it all in the last segment of the second hour coming up today. I'm about to shoot that special report. right now I want to show you a takeover live from the M4 News Center in Austin, Texas, In the last segment of this hour. I went out on the beach here on a family workcation last night and I was mobbed by probably 60 or 70% of the people that walked by me while I was shooting reports on the beach. So then I went and tried to shoot reports just in some bushes over off the beach, away from people, And folks would hear my voice from 20, 30 yards away and come over: fire fighters from New York, Folks that work at military bases here in Florida, waitresses, lawyers. one financial planner came over who was a listener but didn't want to be on record and said he's a huge supporter of what we're doing. My point is these are people from all over the country on vacation in Florida. some were locals and they were all listeners and had been listening in the last few days. So it shows humanity is really, really awake and the gaslighting is not working. So what I'm going to cover- last segment of the next hour- is the fact that the head of the CDC just resigned, right after the last head of the CDC just resigned, and we had the new head of the NIH just resigned. They're all resigning and Gates is going down. He won't go down to the deadly vaccines at this point, the deadly Frankish shots, but he's going down for Jeffrey Epstein and all the rest of it because the system knows that he has to be burned. and so does Klaus Schwab, and so do people like the governor of New York who's now bringing in the global vaccine passports. The Communist China design- now Cuomo- we told you it was coming- is announcing. you've got to have these vaccine passports to go to a ballgame or go to a grocery store. They want corporations, through fascism, to intimidate people into doing it, even though most of the people getting infected already have the COVID vaccine- Most people dying or dying from the COVID vaccine- and it doesn't protect you from future COVID. So again, people are seeing through this giant hoax. The end game was the poisonous, deadly vaccine. That was the plan. We'll go to break it up with Owen Schreuer, Everybody you know. tune in. This is a participation, sport, or liberty or freedom. Please get in the arena. We'll be right back. Your voice counts When you share information, be it over the Internet or in person. it changes the world. The globalists know their agenda is unpopular. They know you're angry.

Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic. it's Alex Jones And now your host, Owen Troyer. Ladies and gentlemen, Info Wars is live on this Tuesday, May 18th 2021. And, in many ways, the world is going completely crazy. You're witnessing this and you're scratching your head. Are other people not seeing what I'm seeing? Do fellow humans not want to get this ship back on the right course? Are our leaders really that corrupt? Are our politicians really that corrupt? Are the people on TV really that phony? Are the activist groups out on the streets every day really that uninformed and brainwashed? And that's just the surface level stuff? Did they know the vaccines were going to be killing tens of thousands? That's just on the first early outset of people being vaccinated. Now you have military walking through the streets of major cities. I still don't even believe this. I'm like in my mind, trying to convince myself. this is a movie or this is parody. No, you're watching the US military go through a district in Dallas, Texas, known as Deep Ellum, to distribute vaccines. Yeah, that's real. It looks like a movie. It feels like a dystopian future. No, this is happening now, My God. And the Pentagon is also announcing they're now going to be monitoring all social media activity of the military for extremist content. Now, really think about what that actually symbolizes. They've been monitoring social media content since it existed. Well, why are they announcing it? Why are they saying that they're doing it now? Everybody knows that they've been doing this. Because this is the left telling you. they're making their move, They're making their totalitarian move And if you have any activity that's against their leftist ideology, their progressive agenda, you will be removed from the military, from the US government and eventually, from any job that the corporations they are allied with control. And then you bring to the angle of fascism, And I have thousands of anti-fascists burning cities, attacking people, destroying communities in the United States of America, And they won't say a word about this corporate fascism, medical tyranny. They won't say a word about the fascism of censoring free speech for an agenda of global elites. They won't say a word about corporations merging. to agree, you have to be vaccinated to shop at their stores or fly on their airplanes. No, they're trying to burn buildings with police officers inside. My goodness, My goodness. Then you have the fake president, the president in thief, Joe Biden. He's fumbling and bumbling his words And you know I made a joke. They act like Joe Biden goes golfing. I said there's no way Joe Biden can golf. He can barely walk on his own two feet. Well, so they had a film crew set up of Joe Biden hitting a golf ball so they could say: hey, look, see, Joe Biden plays golf, and it went horribly wrong. So we'll be getting to that as well. We also have news coming out of multiple states when it comes to the 2020 vote audit. A lot of news coming out of Maricopa County, Arizona. That is like a bubbling cold run of corruption right now that they're trying to cover up the election theft there. And then there's some developments in New Hampshire and we're getting a more clear image of what happened in Georgia as well. And of course, there's more vaccine news: extreme side effects, people dying, tens of thousands in Sweden. They didn't have any COVID, but boy, those vaccines are really hurting them. So that's nice. And then you have another study. as if you haven't seen enough, You have another study that has just been published that once again shows that Democrats, or self identifying Democrats and or liberals, leftist progressives, have no idea Any of the data, any of the statistics, any of the science, any of the facts when they are put into a study where they have to answer questions and they just get every single one wrong. And so it's just yet another one. So it's this combination of all of these different studies. leftists are more likely to steal, less likely to give to charity, All the studies using data. leftists are incredibly inaccurate when they respond to these polls. And then you also had another poll came out that self identifying liberals- 38%- said they had been diagnosed with a mental disorder. But remember, Joe Biden said it's Neanderthal thinking to open Tetris back up. We've had no COVID death since- and that Neanderthal can't figure out how to say Astra Zeneca, You'll find out what he said later today. And, of course, thank God for some of the senators that are willing to stand up against these vaccines, like Texas Senator Bob Hall, who said the American people are now being treated like guinea pigs. So that's going on. Meanwhile, more pastors are being arrested in Canada for daring to open their church for worship. Oh yes, And the Chinese military and the Wuhan lab and Fauci are doing everything they can right now to erase the record of that trilogy of corruption. So there's also developments there. Oh, we also have what's happening in Israel. I mean, this is just not good for anybody at this point And it looks like it's not going to be a ceasefire anytime soon. And Israel seems to really like that. They really seem to be enjoying the people there on the Gaza Strip getting bombed all the time. They really enjoy that a little bit too much, Actually. it's a little cringy. It doesn't really help them. But you know, then you've got the. There's a serious problem in the Democrat Party right now because some of the Democrat Party is on the kill all Jews side. So I mean that's a wild one. You've got members of the Democrat Party that are now on the kill all Jews side of history. That's incredible. The same people pointing their finger in every different direction that they saw a red hat saying Hitler Nazi, are now on the side of history of kill all the Jews. And yet Biden is okaying Israel to bomb the Bajibis out of really whoever he wants, but the Gaza Strip buildings housing Hamas or journalists. And then you have the APs covering up Hamas working with Hamas. I mean this is crazy, This is wild stuff happening. And this is in your backyard. now You've got Palestinians and Jews fighting in the streets of New York And you're just like what the hell? I'm trying to get into a latte here. And then you have CNN hosts saying, well, what is Israel supposed to do? Because they have guests coming on. you know saying hi, Hitler, kill all these Jews. And you know, seeing some of the people in CNN are like whoa, hey, No, literally CNN had to fire a contributor who praised Hitler. So this is a wild one. We're consistently America first here. By the way, do you remember, did you know? was it a week removed from them shutting down our gas pipelines. We're only a week removed from that. That's like ancient history now. They intentionally shut off our gas pipelines and then blamed Russia, And then the governor of Michigan, Whitmer, came out and said: we're going to shut down our pipeline too. Well, now there's more dirt coming out against her. But now the colonial pipeline shippers say their communications system is down And all that news I'm going to get to. I didn't even mention the most disgusting thing. This is. I have the most disgusting thing in front of me. I can't again. I think you think you're in a dystopian future.

I'm not going to say this five times in a row to be obnoxious. I'm saying it because it's the key to victory over these criminals. Last week, the arch-globalist Fauci admitted that roughly half of the CDC's top brass and workers- medical doctors, scientists, nurses, you name it- have taken the so-called COVID-19 frankenshot. I'm going to say it the second time: Around half of the doctors at the CDC and NIH refused to take the frankenshots. They don't trust it. You shouldn't trust it. The vaccines have been banned in most countries around the world. This is an attack on the American people and the people of the world. This is an absolute red flag, smoking gun. Again, let me say it two more times: Around half of the individuals that work at the NIH and CDC, the medical staff, refused to take the vaccines. That's right. The doctors, nurses, scientists do not trust a so-called vaccine. You shouldn't either. You should warn everyone you know about the truth. All right, ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry here I'm late getting back to the desk because I was thirsty there And so unintentional plug here. but we might as well mention our newest product here. We're very excited about it. I love it, The crew loves it.

Don't forget to like that at infowarsstorecom. And of course, it's your supported infowarsstorecom that keeps us on the air. Now, okay, deep breath, Time to get focused here and pile drive into this news very distinctly, And just not get too distracted with all the different crossing lines here. But Biden is completely losing his mind. So I've got these clips here, But you have Biden. he can't say AstraZeneca. today in his speech He says, or yesterday he says Astrovenica. He fumbles around, He says we need to put a million shots in the arms of my first 100 days, Oh boy. But you know, here's a clip of Biden actually getting it right, A clip of Biden actually thinking, thinking clearly and standing on his own two feet. So so here is Biden. He's asked about George Floyd and Martin Luther King And he makes a statement here that should live in infamy forever. But even Dr King's assassination did not have the worldwide impact that George Floyd's death- Oh, we're with George Floyd- was more influential and a better leader than Martin Luther King time in history. now That's what time it is. Oh, that's the timeline we're in. Okay, I get it. So we're in the timeline of half progressive liberal Democrats or with the kill, all Jews crowd, And then the other half, the Biden half. it's not with the kill, all Jews have Jews crowd, but they have the right to defend themselves crowd. And I'm pretty sure of the crowd that George Floyd is a better man than Martin Luther King? Okay, now I know where we're at. Wow, Now look, I'm pretty sure that's an older clip that, for whatever reason, is just now going viral. So the crew had it on my list today, But we were joking around in the break. Just how ridiculous that is like. oh yeah, hey, I think everyone agrees, Right? I mean George Floyd. we should have George Floyd day and George Floyd's family should be influential forever. His name should live George Floyd, the career criminal who sadly died during a police confrontation from a drug overdose and his health problems that he had from years of abusing his body. Now imagine, Imagine- It's like I almost don't even want to say it quite frankly- but if you went out and you started asking people, Do you think George Floyd's death was more influential and more powerful than Martin Luther King's? They would look at you like you had 10 eyes on your forehead. But Joe Biden just says it and he's in the White House. Now They have been saying, because I guess I don't know what it is, Maybe it's to prove that Biden is not a decrepit old husk. They've been talking about how he goes golfing, And so they staged a photo shoot about a month ago of Biden wearing like 30 year old golf shoes. Nobody, In fact, most golf courses probably don't even allow those shoes on the course anymore, I'm not even kidding, They're probably illegal, Those spikes. And so he's wearing these old golf shoes. They don't have a blade of grass on them, So it's obviously just a fake photo shoot. And so they got caught doing that, And so a month later, they finally got Biden to drag him out of bed, you know, and put him on the golf course. This time they wanted to do a video shoot for Biden, And so the photo shoot was a terrible failure. They got caught faking it, And so they had to prove to you. nope, we promise Biden can play golf. I don't believe he could play golf, Definitely not 18 holes, let alone one. So they said: let's have a video shoot now so we can show Biden playing golf. And, ladies and gentlemen, here's how it went: Lines up off the green, about 13 yards down, And oh, oh, you didn't want to see where that went- It went behind him. This is a physically impossible shot. I'm almost impressed. I mean, look, okay, I was going to say there's no way. So he duffs it off the rocks here. Is that the story they're going with What? Okay, let's get serious, though. The guy that can't talk can't play golf. We should not be so surprised. The guy that can't talk can't play golf. It reminds me, though, of Anthony Fauci's first pitch. I know we have that just if you guys just want to, just in case you know, just to remind you. these are the people that lead us. They can't talk, They can't play golf, They can't even throw a simple baseball. 60 feet, six inches, There he goes. That's what we call a wild pitch, ladies and gentlemen, a wild pitch. They're knowing how Fauci cooks the books. They'll probably call that a passball, is probably what they'll do there, Or maybe a strikeout for Fauci. These are your leaders, ladies and gentlemen. These are the leaders of the free world We are told. by the way, a lot of these leaders are really getting caught with their pants down right now, including Gretchen Whitmer. This is a bad one, for now It won't matter, because the media is going to cover for her, as they always do, But info wars still exist, and others still exist. The Gateway Punnits still exist. FAA launches investigation after determining company used to fly Governor Whitmer to. Florida was not authorized to operate charter flights. I wonder how that happened then. Now, remember, Whitmer lied about this. Then it came out she was actually using taxpayer dollars for this. Now it comes out. was she influencing this company to make an illegal flight? How could this be? Certainly she understands the amount of climate change she just caused. Certainly she understands that she just caused the planet Earth to have three less sunrises and sunsets because of this illegal charter flight. Unbelievable, And this is honestly the least of her crimes committed in Michigan. How about all the people that died of COVID because she made hydroxychloroquine illegal? How about all of the businesses that have gone under and the economic stress and distress and just catastrophe because of her lockdowns and fear mongering from COVID? Hey, but she's been able to go out on boats, even though she said going out on a boat was illegal. yet you couldn't do it for COVID, she did it and then she flew illegally And she put COVID in the nursing homes. A lot of people died. Yeah, that's a Democrat, Gretchen Whitmer. Whit, Whit, Whit, Whitmer. What The world is awakening. The world is beginning to understand the globalist paradigm. They are discovering the globalist, the elites, the manipulation, the CFR, the trilateral commission, the Bilderberg group, the Bohemian Grove, the Club of Rome. And so, even though it seems like the globalists are winning, the truth is they've had to come out of the open to attack human freedom because they're actually losing. We have forced them out in the open. So, as bad as these times are and a lot of negative things are about to happen, realize humanity is winning. You've got to trust in the plan of God and trust in the plan of God's justice. That is invincible, That is ethereal, timeless and unstoppable. So don't trust in man. trust in God to lead God and direct your soul. and then take action against the globalists and realize you've got my commitment from Alex Jones and my crew to you. We will never back down from the globalists and we will never surrender. When listeners call into the show and thank me for all I've done, I always stop them and I say thank you for what you've done, Thank you for keeping InfoWars on the air, Thank you for praying for us and thank you for spreading the word.

They are censoring, they are attacking, they are arresting patriots all over the world. The churches in Europe, Australia, the UK and Canada, and even California and New York, are being swat-teamed and clothed because they're non-essential. The tyranny is incredible, But in areas like Texas and South Dakota and Florida, where we have a history of more liberty, all the lockdowns are over. ladies and gentlemen, This is martial law. This has all been a massive martial law drill And now it's more important than ever to spread the word about InfoWars and to support InfoWars.

Fourteen months ago, I began to see on the broadcast. every day when the first world collapses, the third world dies. We have such a complex civilization with so many billions of moving parts that when you shut down the first world, it causes a chain reaction that will devastate the third world and really hurt the first world. Well, now you're hearing about gas shortages all over the United States. That's because the companies and the systems and the drivers that can barely get the job done before delivering gas have been shut down. Plus, the Keystone Pipeline has been shut down, along with other pipelines. The left is now blowing up dams across the US. We're being shut down. Our coal power plants are off as well. Ladies and gentlemen, prepare to be a total slave. The third world is imploding as well. The borders have been removed. Until you wake up- and this is a globalist chai-com takeover, Gregory said- you have no hope. They're announcing that there will be less than two-thirds of the gas needed this summer. So they told you that you're under lockdown one way or another and CNN laughed at you and your family. You're listening to the Alex Jones show From the front lines of the Information War. it's Alex Jones From the front lines of the Information War. it's Alex Jones And sitting in for Alex Jones, our insurer. today we will be hearing from Alex in the next segment and then he has a special report that he's filing right now that we will air Coming up later as well. Let's get into some of this COVID news and the dichotomy of where you have conservative thought leaders or Republicans versus if there are liberal thought leaders. I guess that's kind of an anomaly. Liberals can't think, but just go with it for now. Just the dichotomy of where you stand on the mask and the vaccine and COVID and everything. Now remember you had all of the left, including BDO O'Rourke, the BDI BDO, saying oh wow, this is going to get Texans killed, Removing the mask mandate and opening Texas Abbots going to kill people. That's always what they want to say. And you had Biden come out and he said it was Neanderthal thinking. You know, freedom is Neanderthal thinking. That's really what they want you to understand Freedom is Neanderthal thinking Like Prince Harry comes over here, former Prince Harry, whatever he is now Cuck Harry comes over here. Prince Cuck comes over here and he says: I find the First Amendment to be- what did he say? bogus. What was the word he says He said about the First Amendment was bogus? Bunkus, It's bogus. The First Amendment is bogus. Yeah, Hey, I got news for you, Cuck Boy, Our ancestors whooped the hell out of your great, great, great great grandfathers And we said: get the hell out of here so we could have that bogus First Amendment, Your bogus. But here's my point: is they want you to think that freedom is Neanderthal thinking, Like having free speech. that's Neanderthal thinking. I'm Prince Harry, Am I a real prince? Probably not, And everybody knows it. I don't want to go off into that. So, oh, it's Neanderthal thinking. Oh. but now, as Greg Abbott finds out that we've had zero COVID deaths since we got rid of the mask mandate, which was fake, illegal anyway, He now says Texas will opt out of further federal unemployment benefits tied to the COVID-19 pandemic. There are nearly 60% more jobs open in Texas today than there were in February 2020, making these unemployment benefits no longer necessary. So, just like they did in Florida, So Florida is now leading the way. Abbott is kind of following along in Florida's footsteps, testing the water. first The Sanchez just does triple backflips, leaps in, gets 10 out of 10 scores, And then Abbott is like: I'll test the water, We'll see. But then, okay, he comes along. You can't- I've said this, you can't- drive a mile in Austin right now without seeing three help wanted signs, And most of them are saying starting $15, $20 an hour. So we don't need any more of this. But of course the Biden administration is saying they'll give you $3,600 a year per child in stimulus money Story. is it national file? Trust of the science: MIT study confirms anti-maskers understand better data, better than their opponents. So I don't want to go too far off on this because I got to get to these other news stories. But, folks, I've covered all of these different studies that take people that self-identify as Democrat or liberal versus people that self-identify as conservative or Republican, And every time the Democrat, liberals, their view of reality is completely off base, completely skewed, And so, whether it's mass data, whether it's criminal statistics, whether it's how taxes work, it doesn't matter. They are wrong on all fronts. And so this is just another study proving it. And again, just to put the cherry on top of this, this cake of nonsense that the left is claiming is their intelligence, And they also. in a recent study, 38% of self-identifying liberals say they've been diagnosed with a mental disorder. Well, I would say, as soon as you're considered a liberal, you've been diagnosed with a mental disorder. But I digress. Texas state senator on COVID vaccines. the American people are now the guinea pigs. Let's go to Bob Hall telling it like it is. And have you seen any other vaccine that was put out for the public that skipped the animal test? Never before, especially for children. And as I've what I've read, they actually started the animal test And because the animals were dying, they stopped the test. Folks, I think that's important to understand there, that what we're talking about is the American people are now the guinea pigs. This is the test program that's going on. They they didn't do the human testing and they stopped the animal test because the animals were dying and then they turned it out for the public. And we are now looking at businesses that want to mandate that this experimental vaccine be given to people as a condition of their employment, And yet we have this death count that continues to rise and be totally ignored. I mean, how do you even? it's stunning, it's shocking, it's horrifying, But it's true. We're being treated like guinea pigs. Texas state senator Bob Hall tells it like it is, But how many people knew that? How many people in that Senate committee hearing knew that? on state affairs, Were they stunned by that? Do they care? And again, I have thousands, tens of thousands. even. they have group meetings, they have whole things. they get funded anti-fascists that won't even call that out. How is that not fascism? The vaccine manufacturers making tens of billions of dollars. they're allied with. corporate media pushes the pandemic, pushes the vaccine. They fund politicians push the vaccine, And then the same corporate media takes money and advertising dollars from all these other corporations that employ millions of people. And then they push the vaccine too. And then you can't go to work unless you've taken the vaccine. And then you find out the vaccine has never even gotten an FDA approval. It's not even actually a vaccine by definition. When they did the animal testing on it, the animals died. So they stopped it and then said they were going to give it to you. And at a certain level you almost just get so numb to this because it's like: I mean, what do you do? I mean, what is even the analogy? It's like if you have a friend who's tried to overdose on drugs 10 times and slid his wrists or something, and you know he just continually tries to kill himself. It's just like I mean, what are you going to do? Hey look, you want to take this deadly vaccine. You want to be a human guinea pig. You want to celebrate being a slave. You want to celebrate living in a cage. You want to celebrate being treated like a rodent. I can't help you. You're something else entirely. You and I have nothing in common And that's sad. But here's the other side. Here's PBS reporter Yamiche Alcindor. Yes, she's one of the worst. Here she is. She's begging for more slavery. She's begging for more tyranny So that more lives can be saved. Can I ask you- I want to also switch to COVID, The largest national nurses union is saying that the CDC guidelines on masks is putting frontline workers and especially people of color at risk and that they're calling for the CDC to reverse that. What's the White House stand on that union in particular? saying that they're members and people of color at risk. Well, I would say we don't have any particular response directly to the union. I will say that again: the objective of the CDC. So it's racist. See, we need masks. The disease is racist. I mean these people see racism. when they open the toilet bowl in the morning. These people see racism. They look at a cloud in the sky, They look at a frog jumping. I mean everything is racist to them. That's their entire economy is racism. and how much racism they can, or pity for racism, I mean it's just ridiculous. So you have the left begging for vaccines, begging for corporate mandates, begging for vaccine passports to be free. again, That's the left wanting you to wear a muzzle. and then you have the right. We don't want to wear muzzles, We don't want to take a human experimental DNA modification vaccine. Globalist puppet Joe Biden wasted no time blaming Russia, with no evidence, for the shutdown of the East Coast gasoline pipeline. that goes from Houston right up through New York City. It supplies more than half of the gasoline to the East Coast. But who is it that actually shut down the main pipeline from Canada through the Midwest to Houston to refine the oil that's then turned into gas? and simply the East Coast? That's right. Joe Biden shut down the Keystone pipeline right after it was completed. Joe Biden did that to America. He has the history, He has the background. He's the one that promised to get us off of fossil fuels. He's the one that's trying to extend the lockdown of the country. Remember, ladies and gentlemen, that the New World Order wants a post industrial world and they want the United States, Europe and Australia crippled So communist China can be dominant.

If the unvaccinated get vaccinated, they will protect themselves and other unvaccinated people around them. If they do not, states with low vaccination rates may see those rates go up, may see this progress reversed. Ultimately, those who are not vaccinated will end up paying the price. I've not taken a vacation in 20-plus years where I actually ever take off, and I promised my wife and children that I was going to do it. But the news breaking today is so incredibly important that I'm here at the beach and what's left of America and I've got to go on air and lay out and break down what's unfolding. You see, the IMF and the World Bank and the private central banks that basically own and control the planet won a World ID system, and the man they hired to basically set it up is named Klaus Schwab. He ran the whole UN sustainability program. Now he heads up the Davos Group. They came out five years ago and called for a great reset to cut global carbon, but also to create a World ID for every citizen. And Klaus Schwab said they would use the fear of a virus to bring in this World ID, this World Medical System, which will form the basis again of the World ID. And he told French television five years ago that once they put this in place, they're going to start implanting microchips under everyone's skin to track and trace and control us. Well, Biden came out a few days ago and said: okay, you don't have to wear the mask anymore if you're vaccinated. But we knew what was coming next. Cuomo, Governor of New York, came out and said: you need to be vaccinated, you need to show proof to get on trains, to get on buses later to get on airplanes as they're playing. So first you've got to wear the mask because you're dirty and you're bad. Now the mask can go away. we predicted this a year ago. but you have to have the vaccine And we're going to play a clip of Cuomo here in a moment, but notice he's very slick about this. He explains: oh, if the business would like to, they should ask you to do this. So they want to get the program going in these blue cities, in these authoritarian regions, and see if people will willingly waive their rights to be the starter group to get all the corporate minions and enforcers at the sports stadiums, at the malls, at the grocery stores accustomed to demanding these QR codes that Gigi Pink's called for that are then tied to your medical records. This violates your HIPAA rights. It's so incredibly dangerous And it's not like it's speculation that this is going to be abused. It's not like I'm just saying that that's the case. Out of the gates they're saying: this is a world ID, The UK is calling for it, Other authoritarians like Cuomo are calling for it And in fact, they're actually implementing it now And it's all being done color of law. It's all extremely, extremely on a scale of one to 10, a 10 and a half or, in Spinal Tap lingo, an 11 on the tyranny Richter scale. When you got vaccinated, you got a card. You could also have the Empire Pass, which is on your smartphone, But on a vaccinated venue, you will be asked, or can be asked, to produce that card and proof of vaccination. So it can be the Excelsior Pass or the card, but you have to show that when you enter the venue Or, if you're asked, you have to present that. There's a QR code on it that you'll be able to use to present this proof of your vaccination. Thousands and thousands of people have used the Excelsior Pass and or shown proof of vaccination so far, So this is not something that's new. What's new would be that it's 100% of all people in those places. You have to 100% vaccinated. You guys are waiting for us, are you, Dude? I am waiting for you. Oh, my God, Your shirt is red. That was amazing. Johnny Cash, Yeah, they just ripped earlier, So I ripped this off. Good to see you, Dude. I heard you. I was like how you doing man? Yeah, I heard that voice. I was like I know that voice. What if you guys take a Fauci and all the trouble is getting caught in the wool on a lamb Man? that is just a. They talk about it at work every day. It's something that we go over. That's like our morning meeting is talking about all the crap. that's Well, exactly Well, now they're going to try to make you have a medical ID that proves you have one of these vaccines. But half of the CDC and NIH won't even take the vaccine. I know a lot of medical professionals that won't take it, but it's optional for them right now. That's why we've got to say we're not doing it. We've got to say, hey, check this out. So I work on a military base and I got an email today that says if you're vaccinated, you don't have to wear a mask. If you're not vaccinated, you still got to wear a mask. Well, that's exactly what they're doing. They were always planning to say, wear the mask like you're bad. And then they want to then use that as a way to identify who's vaccinated and not and try to create a world ID, So bigger than the vaccine. the mask leaves the vaccine leaves you the world ID, And so that's the big thing they're pushing for. And then, once the big corporations have that, it's total control. What do you do after that man? I was strolling baby. That's what I'm probably doing: Staying out of the mask, man, Staying out of the medical ID. But they even did that. I got a school email about him saying: as parents, if we're vaccinated, then we don't have to wear masks. We don't have to wear masks and everything. It's all intimidation, Like you're dirty, you're bad. If you don't have the vaccine, you better store your mask. It's all like the mask give you bacterial pneumonia. They'd ever fix anybody. Yeah, Yeah, We'll stand up and speak out about it, Because the plan is to incrementally force us to take vaccines which are experimental. That's the problem, man. That's the thing is. you can look it up and it's an experimental medicine, is all it is. I was watching that deal the other day. I think it was you. We were showing that there's nothing on the information sheet. Absolutely, They're using that as a lab rat. Absolutely, That's all you are as a lab rat, Absolutely. And because they said they didn't study this on lab rats, but they did under other vaccine names in 2012 at UT And it caused blood clots and heart attacks in most of the rats. So they said: never make a vaccine. So that's why this time, they skipped animal trials with a new vaccine, But it's still basically the same vaccine that makes your body attack its own proteins. Yeah, That's why women are having all these problems. men are having problems. I've been hearing about that. Well, God bless you guys. Hey, how about it? Can I please get a picture with you? Let's do it, brother. Yeah, Thank you so much, man. So this is a premeditated formula. First you've got to wear the mask, You've got to stay in your house, You're bad. Martial law is okay, You're not essential. Small businesses are shut down, Churches are shut down, but Walmart and Target are open. And then it's oh, you could take the mask off. But now we need everybody to find out if you've been vaccinated, and intimidate you and bully you into having the vaccine. Oh, but then that vaccine's not going to be enough. They're going to want more and more and more. And again, they're not even vaccines, They're totally experimental. All you need was vitamins and minerals and sunshine. And so the good news is, while we're out here shooting this in Florida, just the last five minutes, we had group after group after group come by. Everybody was a listener and understood what was going on, And so, again, that shows the mass awakening is happening. So they were all saying, Alex, we need you, Keep it up. No, I need all of you watching and listening to take this video and share it on your email. share on your text message. It's harder for them to censor there, then on Facebook, then on Twitter, then on YouTube, And realize this is a diabolical plan to bring in a world government under the UN, under the WHO. So listen again to the words very carefully of the governor. More than half the deaths in the state were sending sick people with flu, pneumonia and COVID into nursing homes, knowing it would kill them, And then- $53,000 per person- They intubated them, even though scientists up front said that will kill people when they have this COVID to put them on a ventilator. When you got vaccinated, you got a card. You could also have the Empire Pass, which is on your smartphone, But on a vaccinated venue you will be asked, or can be asked, to produce that card and proof of vaccination. So it can be the Excelsior Pass or the card, But you have to show that when you enter the venue Or, if you're asked, you have to present that QR code on it that you'll be able to use to present this proof of your vaccination. So this has been a very systematic, diabolical plan. Remember the third world still locked down, starving to death, And the UN is going to use that collapse to ship them all here. So that's part of that: replacement migration, But we're being taught in the West that we're not essential as well in being collapsed in third world status. This is all a systematic plan. So Fauci, Bill Gates, Klaus Schwab- all of them need to be criminally investigated, as Senator Rand Paul has said, And need to be tried and then sent to prison because they cooked this thing up. They created the gain of function. They did it all to Wuhan lab, as scientists that we had on 16 months ago on air told you, Because this was all a major controversy in 2015 at Chapel Hill, North Carolina, when they did 11 total programs and moved into Wuhan, all run by Bill Gates and Fauci. So Fauci had to be the controller of this so he could get away with it when they released it to cause a collapse, a shutdown in the economy and to remove President Trump from office. The only problem is President Trump believed it was a regular vaccine. He wanted to get the economy going. He didn't want them holding the economy hostage. So he said: accelerate the vaccine and that gave them liability protection. Now they can get away with it. So Trump needs to really understand that the public is turning against this, Most people are refusing to take it, and that half the doctors at the NIH and CDC have refused as well. And that's really the big news everybody needs to know. And while I've been here in Florida just a few days, I have run into dozens of people that once said: my mom, my dad died of it, My brother's dying, My church is dying Totally healthy. She took the vaccine, My son had convulsions, My doctor got paralyzed. I mean, this is really going on and big tech's trying to censor and control that. But what we do know is they want a world ID based on a medical system for a global social credit score to track and trace every fast in your life. They're now doing it. It's antithetical to a free society. Everybody has to say no and has to resist and has to halt again for the indictment which is being sought after right now of tyrants like Governor Cuomo. Again, we'll be covering all this at bandvideo NymphoWarscom. If you're watching this transmission, you are the resistance. One of the most common questions I get on air but also off air when I'm just out and about, is: Alex, what do I say to my family about the vaccines Which? how do I warn them? Well, the problem is there's so many problems with it, So many facts. It's the history of contaminated vaccines, The fact that they have liability protection in the US and Europe, The fact that they've been caught adding sterilants and cancer viruses and other things to vaccines, And the whole history of secret experimentation on at-risk groups of poor blacks, poor whites, Native Americans- the list goes on and on. But what about the fact that Fauci testified to Congress, and so did the head of the CDC, in late May of 2021, that around half of the NIH CDC staff- medical doctors, neurologists, scientists- have refused to take the vaccine until they can say, Yeah, I think what half of the doctors are scared to take it. that's the same thing in the private practices out there somewhere. numbers that that's not something I'm going to be taking. That's very, very simple. There's your answer, Gerald of South Carolina. go ahead, you're on the air, trying to move quicker. Hey, Alex, Welcome. I would like to say, first off, thanks for being the voice of reason and, amongst all this stupidity, Wanted to warn people. I've been trying to get ahold of you for a year. okay, I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away. Living defense saved my life. They had me on antibiotics for two years. that almost killed me. Living defense brought me back. I wanted to just quote from the Bible. Jesus is saying as to where we are right now. This is Matthew 24, verse nine. Then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you, And you shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake, And then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another. That's right where we're at, brother, And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country, no matter what they say, And that's why the enemy hates it, because God created this country. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Is Anthony Fauci smarter than a ten-year-old? I think not. I have the evidence. A ten-year-old stood in front of Martin County School Board members in Florida, hoping to make masks optional for the remaining days of the school year. He called out the teachers for their hypocrisy. Here is the clip that's going massively viral: School board members. my name is John, I just turned ten years old. Talk a little closer to that. I just turned ten years old and I am a fourth grader at Felix A Williams. I expected school to be a little bit different in the beginning, but I didn't think it would stay this way all year long And I was surprised by the rules. A lot of them didn't make any sense to me, like the fact that we were not allowed to play on the playground or have student council or turned to face each other at lunch and we also have to wear masks outside, at PE and on track. I love my school and all but my teachers seem really stressed and that makes me feel bad. One teacher walks around with a clipboard full of referrals for any student who's mask isn't on properly. It makes me feel scared. That same teacher yells at us having our masks down at drink of water while we are outside in car line. She told us we had to wait until we were in our parents' car to have a drink of water. She had her mask down the entire time while she was yelling at us, which makes me and all my friends very mad. This happens a lot And it seems unfair. teachers take their masks off while they yell at us kids and that we need to pull hours up. I asked my mom if there's a word for this and she said there is Hypocrisy. Wearing a mask all day makes me feel really tired and gives me really bad headaches. Sometimes I miss school and I need to lay low in the dark until they're gone. My mask also sticks to my face when it's really hot and it makes it hard to breathe. I feel like I can't catch my breath and that makes me feel claustrophobic and anxious. It's really stressful. I finished taking all of my Alpha Says and I had a hard time focusing with the mask on. A few weeks ago I ran into my teacher outside of school. She didn't even recognize me because she's never seen my face before, But I knew it was her because she sits at her desk a lot without the mask on. I know my teacher has asthma and everything, but I understand why it's hard for her to wear a mask and I think she should have that choice. But I should too. I have allergies and I feel really anxious with my face covered, But I'm not allowed a mask like her. It seems unfair. All this seems unfair and it doesn't make sense. I miss seeing people's face. I miss the way things used to be. I'm scared they'll never go back to normal Breathing really doesn't seem like something we should have to ask any other people for permission for. Please make the mask optional today. It would be so awesome to end the school year on a really happy note like that. Thank you for your time. Thank you, John, You did a good job. So there you go. You know. it's just amazing that this divide, this fracture that we have right now. but what's so depressing about it, or upsetting about it, is the root cause, the motivational factor for people who want to: because you can wear a mask forever. You can wear a mask the rest of your life. Many of these leftists, I'm sure will They're announcing that they will Fine Freak, But they want you to do it too. They want you to be a part of their cult. They want to force you to do it, And so the root cause of this, the driving factor, is that these are authoritarians, These are totalitarians, And that's really synonymous with a cult. And so that's what we're experiencing: Forcing you to wear a mask, Forcing you to take a vaccine. So I just want all the people out there that are on that side of history to just admit what you are, admit who you are, and just come out and be honest. You do not believe in human freedom, You do not believe in self-government, You are not a fan of freedom. Listen up, patriots. I'm running a sale- that's the biggest I've ever run- on three products that are already selling out. Well then, why am I selling it then, at 50% off or 60% off, depending on which sale you go with? Because I know a lot of you are on the fence. You haven't tried it And I know you're going to get hooked once you do So. for one week only, we're running 50% off on ultimate fish oil, 50% off on winter sun with D3 and K3 immune system and, oh my gosh, people love this so much. We've sold out for months back in limited supply. Turbo force, 10-hour clean energy is 40% off, But you can get them all three together in the optimum trifecta pack for 60% off. We've never offered that on these products. It's basically a lost leader. I want you to get them, I want you to try them, I want you to love them. So, believe me, you're going to be a blown away. Go to infowarstorecom. We're running this Monday through Sunday and the deal is over- Best deal ever. Take advantage of it at infowarstorecom and fund the info war. We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance Rallying Patriots worldwide. You're listening to the Alex Jones Show. All right. next phase, the globalist takeover, is a world ID through a global medical ID that will finally be implemented with an implantable microchip other than skin or in the brain, as Klaus Schwab, head of the Davos Group, told National Friends Television, and of course we played that for you last week. the full video is posted on infowarstorecom. This is an absolutely draconian system that has nothing to do with safety and security. It has to do with tracking and tracing the economy and putting carbon taxes in place that make it impossible for small businesses and companies and individual families to operate, so the society collapses, so they can carry out an orderly depopulation agenda. So, that said, they're now moving towards the vaccine passports. They're now moving towards the Chinese social credit score model coming up later in the broadcast today, either in the last segment of this hour, if it's done, or the last segment of the next hour, if we don't get it complete, because I just shot it. We're going to air a 10-minute detailed report breaking all this down. that is so important and we lay out the crossroads that we've now reached. But that said the reason I'm making this announcement at the start of the second hour, and then I'm sure it's about to take back over- and he's got Leo Zagami on next hour- is the fact that I'm getting a bunch of text messages and calls from people that work at hospitals, people also that are in the military and folks that work for Home Depot, or just some of the texts and calls I've got in the day that they're being told: tell us your vaccine status. They're trying to bully you into violating HIPAA. They don't have the right to do that. They're trying to intimidate you to wave your right and do it yourself Or don't clock in tomorrow. So it's pure color of law fraud And if I was you folks, I would. I'm not normally like this, but this is medical tyranny And these folks are interfacing with the UN, the globalist, with this experimental Franken-shot. I would record them telling you to do that. They just criminal. And then I would definitely move forward and tell them they're violating your rights And they try to fire you for it. They're going to be in big trouble and they're going to end up being sued and they're going to lose that suit for sure. They're just hoping that in general acquiescence. we all accept this and it sets the precedent of a new custom of having a way of our rights and basically being raped. We cannot let all our forebears did be thrown to the wayside. We have to say no to this medical tyranny right now, And so Owen is going to do a great job. He's doing a great job, But tomorrow hosting the show. I've talked to Owen. He's agreed that he thinks it's a good idea to open the phones up specifically to Mara, not just for medical workers with their vaccine stories, or nurses with their vaccine stories, or callers with all their horror stories, because we don't screen your call. People just call in. Every call is a horror story. Everything I've heard in Bobbitt and Florida has been a horror story. Everything I heard in Texas is a horror story on the ground as well. But this is going to be not about horror stories or your stories of loving the vaccines. This is going to be about: have you had trouble getting into the grocery store or getting into Home Depot, or has your employer tried to intimidate you to see if you have a vaccine? A lot of colleges are announcing that you, quote- have to have it. They don't tell you there's fine print or you actually don't. Again, this is all color of law fraud. So I know tomorrow, while I'm hanging out with my family here in sunny Florida. I'm going to be listening to Owen back in the ATX. take your calls on that subject for at least two hours of the show, because this is important, and there's nothing better than your on-the-ground intelligence, your on-the-ground reports of what's actually happening, And I may get a few guests on as well that have been contacting me and see if they'll come on air and actually tell you what they witnessed for themselves. But this is outrageous and it's illegal. Back to Owen Schroder and a live broadcast, You know, and again it just goes back to the same thing, which is so incredible. I just I don't know how to put it anymore, because these people are never going to stop pushing, forcing you to take a vaccine and forcing you to wear a mask, a mask that is unhealthy for you, a vaccine that is deadly. So it's beyond just that they don't even believe in freedom, It's. they want to control your body, They want to rape you, And so it just makes me sick. I'm just disgusted. Now I got a video clip that we're going to have coming up, and I can play all the video clips. We played another one of a PBS reporter. I got Mika Bersensky on MSNBC. I'm still going to wear the mask. The science says to still wear the mask. And then you see the comment sections where all the dumbass brainwashed vaccine heads: What do we have to start calling these people? Because you can't call them liberals anymore? It's just, you cannot call them liberals anymore. You can call them Democrats, but we need to have a new term for these people: Communists. it doesn't quite say it. This is beyond the realm. This is beyond the pale. This is beyond the scope of any political group or anything we've ever seen. This is a worldwide death cult And it used to be just the secret shadow societies manipulating the world and humanity. but now their pawns, now their minions, are completely brainwashed and completely bought into the cult and they're coming for us, They're coming for everyone, not in the cult. What's the movie? I forget the name of the movie: The Body Snatchers, I think. or it's like Invasion of the Body Snatchers. That's what this is. These are the Body Snatchers. So the Body Snatchers want you to wear a mask, The Body Snatchers want you to take a vaccine. This is Invasion of the Body Snatchers. And then, because they know not everyone is a Body Snatcher like them, they know that they need to identify you And then, once they've identified you, they then need to come get you and either put a muzzle on your face and or put a needle in your arm. So that's why you're seeing this outcry. They hate you being free, They hate you making your own decisions, They hate you having free speech to push back against their wild ideas and conspiracy theories And their fake science. they hate all of it. They hate you. so they need full control and they need to own your body. And then Hillary Clinton comes out and Biden comes out and they say: you want to be free again? Take the vaccine. You have two choices: Take the vaccine or wear a mask. No, I don't. I got any choice. I want Fuck you, Joe Biden. And then Hillary Clinton says: you want your life back? Take a vaccine. Shut up, bitch. I'm not going to listen to these damn Body Snatchers anymore. And those are like the heads of the Body Snatchers And again now all their minions. you read all the comment sections. I'm still going to wear my mask, even though I'm vaccinated. And they say they come up with all these wild excuses as to why. Oh, there's different variants. There's the India variant and the Europe variant. What about the Chinese virus. Don't say that, bigot, Just total mind control. Oh, But I could get sick if somebody around me is unvaccinated and I have no way of knowing. Well, if the vaccine's safe and effective, then what are you so concerned about? Oh, it's not safe or effective, and you know it, And you're admitting that. It's just unbelievable. I can't even. You know what's funny. I was going to do kind of like a deep tease on this. I don't know what is more sick: The Body Snatchers that want to put a muzzle on your face and a needle in your arm because of their own worldview, So because of all of their own beliefs and their worldview, they now want to dominate you. But that is not even the most disgusting, disturbing thing I have on my desk today, And so I mean I was going to do a big deep tease about this, but I'll just show you this now. So I'm not sure what's more disgusting: The Body Snatchers that want to control you and don't believe in freedom or this? I apologize, but nobody else is going to report this, but this is the sick world we live in. A knitted penis for extremely small girls to wear in their pants if their parents believe them to be transgender. It is intended for girls so young. they demonstrate the product in a diaper And it's literally a business. Bitty bug soft packer and they knit male genitals for you to put in your daughter's pants. So are we living in hell or is this comedy for angels? Are we living in hell or is this comedy for angels? Because I mean, this is like redonkulous. We should be laughing at how outrageous this is. This should be like fringe shock value comedy. No, they're actually making knit penises for your daughter's diaper. The federal government commissioned secret radiation experiments on thousands of non-consenting patients. Hundreds of hospitals in the US injected healthy men, women and children with uranium and plutonium at dosage levels ranging from non-therapeutic to lethal killing many of the test subjects. Endgame blueprint for global enslavement is one of the most important films ever made. Fourteen years ago, we tracked and documented the Bilderberg Group's activities and their plan for a great reset, using the threat of a fake virus. The film now is more important than ever When it's shot to number one on Amazon. last year they banned it. We have it back in print, available now at infowarsportcom, Selling them as low as $3.95 a piece when you buy them in bulk and there's a zero country code, so anywhere on the planet, you can make copies. In fact, I want you to make copies. You are the Palmer beers: 1776 worldwide. 1776 worldwide- Endgame blueprint for global enslavement, available now at infowarsportcom. I'm not going to say this five times on the road to the adoption. I'm saying it because it's the key to victory over these criminals. Last week, the arch-globalist Fauci admitted that roughly half of the CDC's top brass and workers- medical doctors, scientists, nurses, you name it- have taken the so-called COVID-19 franken shot. I'm going to say it the second time: Around half of the doctors at the CDC and NIH refused to take the franken shots. They don't trust it. You shouldn't trust it. The vaccines have been banned in most countries around the world. This is an attack on the American people and the people of the world. This is an absolute red flag smoking gun. Again, let me say it two more times: Around half of the individuals that work at the NIH and CDC- the medical staff- refused to take the vaccines. That's right. the doctors, nurses, scientists do not trust a so-called vaccine. You shouldn't either. You should warn everyone you know about the truth. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Seriously, what has this world become when you have bitty bug soft pecker-packers. I mean, let me just read here: The bitty bug soft pecker-packer is a custom prosthetic packer in sizes appropriate for children, made from soft, durable yarn and polyester, filling a knitted penis for extremely small girls to wear in their pants if their parents believe them to be transgender, And they demonstrate the product in a diaper because it's for toddlers. In unrelated news, South Carolina becomes the fourth state to approve of firing squats. So seriously though, are we living in hell? or is this comedy for angels? Because you hear this and it's just surface-level face value: nauseating, disgusting, disturbing on so many different levels. And, of course, you know this is just the perverts. Again, we just wanted to put their hand down your daughter's pants. These are just perverts who want to put their hands in your toddler's diaper. These sick freaks. Body snatchers- Oh yeah, Anybody involved with knit penises for baby girls. Anybody going into a diaper to put a penis into a baby girl? Yeah, I have a feeling you're a body snatcher. I bet you wear two masks too. You're going to take your vaccine too. I bet you get mad when you see someone without a mask. It's the same people. It's the same death cult. But so yeah, this is disgusting, This is hell, This is demonic, This is diabolical. Or is it comedy for angels? Because I could sit back and laugh at this. I could joke. I mean seriously, like, oh, hey, we can do an SNL skit. You know, you show up at the Biddy Bug Softpecker store. You're like, oh yeah, how can I help you? Hi, I've got a six-month-old daughter and I want her to have a penis. It's like, well, that's good for you, sir, Very progressive. I see you're not wearing a mask. Are you vaccinated? Of course Johnson and Johnson Feels great. Wonderful, sir, Is that your daughter right there with you? Why, yes, Here. I've got some special ones over here with different sizes. Let's try them on, Do you mind? Oh, absolutely, Put your hand down my daughter's pants, please. Perfect, I'm your Petty Packer, Biddy Bug Softpecker Packer salesman, and my hand is now going into your daughter's diaper, and that's OK. Of course It's progressive. You're gay, right? Well, not today, Maybe tomorrow, though. Yeah, you know, I really like that size right there. Yeah, Oh, that's wonderful. We have that one in blue or black or white. I noticed that your daughter's white. Do you want to be transracial and have a black knit penis for your daughter, Or do you want to go with the normal flesh tone for a Caucasian. Well, I kind of want my daughter to have a really big lap hog, So whatever the biggest size you got is. I mean seriously like, is this comedy for angels? And you can laugh at this stuff, but no, These people are actually thinking about putting a knit penis in your daughter's diaper. Who's going to be the first celebrity to put a bulge in their infant's diaper for a political statement? It sounds something right up Chrissy Teigen's alley, doesn't it? That sounds right up Chrissy Teigen's alley. I mean, this woman has some serious problems there. actually, I'm not even kidding. I mean that. almost feel bad for that couple. Funny enough, though, just like Meghan Markle, Chrissy Teigen came from a briefcase salesman. So are they like recruiting people out of the deal or no deal? briefcase model deal there. But okay, so there you go, The bitty bug, soft pecker packer. And in unrelated news, South Carolina becomes fourth state to approve firing squad. Are we in hell or is this comedy for angels? All right, ladies and gentlemen, Where do we go next? By the way, we don't even cover this, but it's weird. We have the US military admitting UFOs exist and they have hundreds of hours of footage. and now they're showing you the footage and it's like not even news, It's not even a blip on the radar. Myself included, I don't even have any of that news on my desk. But I'm just sitting here thinking what's next? How does it get crazier? I mean, who would have predicted knit penises for your baby, Right? I mean drag queen story time. You're like: oh, that's as far as it goes. You know grown men with boners bouncing up infants on their blap and saying, no, we're reading to them. Yeah, oh yeah, oh sure You could do that without your, you know, dingling out. You could do that without your Johnson out. You could do that without your drag queen makeup on if you just wanted to read to kids. So it's not really about that, is it now? But where does it go from here? Now, at drag queen story time, they'll take your little daughter up and they'll say: or? they'll take your little daughter up and they'll say: oh, your little daughter, Jane. she wants to be a boy. And guess what? We got a little, a little knit penis for her. Here you go, Jane, fondle the ball and shaft. It's yours now. It's okay, It's your. it's your balls and shaft now, Jane. Yeah, play with yourself. And then it'll just be like the Clinton, the Clinton years where they had that, that that person in a congressional testimony say we need to teach kids how to masturbate. So you know they couldn't just have men and women and teachers sign on to that. That didn't really work. So they kind of test ran it with the Clinton. I forget see if you can find out that lady's name- or wasn't a man, I can't remember. Rush Limbaugh used to play the clips all the time. The person out of the Clinton administration says we need to teach kids how to masturbate. But most people don't want anything to do with that. So they had to find an end around And so they created drag queen story time. Oh, now you've found the perverts that want to teach kids how to masturbate And you've found a way to disguise the whole thing with woke liberalism- Dumbass left that falls for anything. So, oh, oh, we're just. we're just trying to open the world up to new ideas. This is liberal and loving and progressive. It's drag queen story time. No, it's a bunch of perverted men that want to touch your child's genitals, And then you know what I mean. I won't even sit here and demonize all of them. Maybe there are some drag queen story times just want to read to kids, whatever, But you know this is an end around to teach your kids how to masturbate. There it is. Remember that time Bill Clinton fired his surgeon general for encouraging masturbation education: Jocelyn Elders, That was all for the public just to see. oh yeah, they didn't want that message out there, Please. they all knew that that was going to happen. Clinton knew who Elders was. It was all part of the program They just found out in the 90s. okay, people aren't ready for us to masturbate their children. People aren't ready for perverts and pedophiles to be openly running the world. So are we going to reach a point where at drag queen story time, you're going to have queen catfish stunk? Or you know they have all these crazy names: Kitty litter, queen kitty litter, which is, you know, slang for eating someone else's you know anus, Sorry, but that's you know. these are the people that read your kids: Queen, kitty litter, you know sexual term for eating anus. They read your kids. Are we going to get to a point where now, oh, Miss Kitty litter has a bag full of knit penises for your little girls to come up so they can experience what it's like to be transgender. And then Miss Kitty litter was up Here. fondle the shaft and balls. It's yours now. It's okay, Miss Kitty litter. Oh my God. Oh my God. We're in hell. or is this comedy for angels?

Joe Biden, saying you have two choices: Wear a mask or take a vaccine. I actually can think of a lot of other choices. I could think of a choice where I take that mask and that vaccine and stick it up. Well, you know the old blowhole for old Joe. So it's, you know, just open government tyranny. You have two options: Mask or vaccine. What about freedom? Or then there's Hillary Clinton's tweet. It's pretty simple: Get vaccinated, Get your life back, Get my life back. Do you own my life? Are you in charge of me? Am I your property? Did you take my life from me? You did, didn't you? You tried to, you wicked bitch. Get your life back, Get vaccinated. Of course, the irony is it could kill you, But don't worry about that. Yeah, some will die, Some will die. Yeah, Remember when Trump said: hey, you know people die, You know this stuff happens. He was the worst person in the world. But, hey, people die from the vaccine. Hey, you know what People are. so you know, hey, take the vaccine. People are dying. Well, you know, people die, People die. So I have to die of unnatural causes because you're going to stick a needle in my arm. Well, people die. you know, I mean it. just, this stuff just happens. So, yeah, yes, there will be a mass human sacrifice for this new world order cult with the vaccines. Yes, absolutely Yes, yes, Man, I'll tell you this. this stuff is really scary, man. I mean, government tyranny is one thing when it's being proposed by weak, feckless frauds and criminals like Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden. But when you see this vaccine rollout and you see the side effects and you know it's not been tested on humans and you know it killed the animals it's been tested on and you know tens of thousands are dying from it And you know you don't need it And yet it's being forced upon our society, It's being forced upon us. and then you learn about the vaccine shedding. I've got people that work at medical practices telling me now that a new side effect they're hearing about is men that has sexual relations with vaccinated women are experiencing some interesting swelling down under. So like an extra, an extra large penis net type of situation. So is that, is that? is that what's next? I mean, seriously, when are we going to know? it'll be a year or two before we really know the side effects of just the vaccine. How long is it going to be till we know the side effects of being around the people that are getting the vaccine and the shedding? We already know about all these new variants of the virus Those are caused because of the vaccine. So it's really sick and disgusting stuff. And then it's even more diabolical that it so a vaccine manufacturer. if you die from a vaccine, the vaccine manufacturer has no liability. That's, that's the secret court, That's how it's the law, which is totally illegal but is written against the Geneva Convention, the Nuremberg Code. But if your business forces you to take a vaccine and then you have a side, a negative side effect, an adverse reaction, that business is held culpable. How is that fair? Well, because it's all about shutting down big business or, excuse me, small business. The big businesses will be able to afford it, The small businesses. one one negative vaccine side effect you get forced to take it. That that's going to kill your small business. You're done So. it'll end up being just another weapon against small business, just like the entire COVID fake pandemic was. But as Bob Hall, the Texas State Senator, said, the American people are now guinea pigs, And we really are. We really are the guinea pigs. I think we've been vaccinated more than any other country. Here's what's happening in Sweden. Sweden records more than 30,000 cases of side effects tied to the COVID-19 jab. Modern, Moderna, Pfizer and AstraZeneca are the three jabs there. More than 30,000 cases of side effects, And of course, I think it's like, I think that their their official numbers right now are, I think, 4% of the negative side effects are death. I mean, I'm no mathematician, but if you have, it's probably around like 10% negative side effects from the vaccine and then 4% of that 10% is is is death. I think those that's the numbers we're getting right now. But hey, you want to be free again, You want to get your life back. You got to take that vaccine And now they have it. The vaccine passports are here. Governor Cuomo announces it, just like we told you. After he kills your grandma, he tells you you no longer have to wear a mask, but the vaccine passport will be required. There's your medical tyranny, There's your fascism, If Antifa wants to ever wake up and figure out what's really going on. We're not suggesting criminal violence, of course, but you know, if Antifa took its normal legal activities- I mean the legal street activity that Antifa is engaged in a regular basis- I think they should take their regular, normal street activity, which is totally legal because they don't even exist, And if they did, they're not violent. They should take their totally normal, nonviolent street activity to the governors that are forcing the population to vaccinate And they should take it to the vaccine manufacturers, clinics and the heads of all these big pharmaceutical companies. Of course, again, I'm not encouraging violent. Antifa is not violent. Antifa is not violent at all. It's just an ideology. So I think Antifa should take its ideology to Governor Cuomo's house, to Governor Cuomo's office and to the heads, the headquarters of all these vaccine manufacturing companies. I'm not calling for violence. Antifa is just an idea that doesn't exist. I'm just saying very anti-fascist. that idea should be applied to the Democrat governors that are introducing fascism. And now in the latest CDC numbers, they admit 223 people have died from COVID after getting the vaccine. Oh, another thing: Info Wars is tomorrow's news. today Told you that was coming, But of course that was an easy one to predict. Anybody could have predicted that, really, if they were just being honest with themselves. Texas celebrates zero COVID deaths daily two months after Biden called reopening Neanderthal thinking. Yeah, being free is Neanderthal thinking to the Democrats. Being free is Neanderthal thinking to liberals. Being free is Neanderthal thinking to leftists. You need to be controlled by them. And then we have this story at infowarscom- and guys, I know we have the video if you just want to roll the B roll with clip 12.. Another pastor arrested in Canada following anti-lockdown church service. Unbelievable Pastor Tim Stevens of Fairview Baptist Church in Calgary, is seen on video being detained by Alberta Health Services and the Calgary police in front of his wife and crying children. So that's what they're doing in Canada now, By the way. in fact, you know what? this is actually an interesting thing, I'm wondering. so the NHL playoffs have started now, the hockey very popular in Canada. I don't think they're allowed to play hockey in Canada, but it's interesting enough because the American, the teams that are in America and the NHL are having home games with audience members. But I'm wondering if the teams in Canada are allowed to even have home games, but so you can go play hockey. You can go play hockey if you're in Canada, but you can't go to church. But for the Canadian baseball team, the Toronto Blue Jays, they're not allowed to have baseball games in Canada. I think they're playing in Florida or somewhere else. So boy Canada, boy that sucks. Justin Trudeau has really taken a big, fat steaming crap on Canada, hadn't he? I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021, and I just want to say something.

TheBioProscom- You're listening to the Alex Jones Show. It's the new normal inside the New World Order. The military will be dropping by your home or business to give you the experimental genetic engineering shot And, like President Biden said, if you don't take it, you're going to pay. I've got some good news for you and I've got some extremely bad news for you, But overall, humanity is awakening and is fighting back against the globalist takeover plan and against the new orderly population agenda. First off, just breaking today, the head of the CDC, who's only been in for six months to replace Redfield, has stepped down, After the head of their immunology- that's, injections, vaccinations and infectious disease director stepped down a few days ago as well. I was told by sources inside the CDC and NIH a few weeks ago that there was a major rebellion, not just in the general public, not just in private practice- medical doctors, epidemiologists and scientists- that we've all seen Thousands of them going public and big tech censoring them and trying to silence them, but there's been a major rebellion inside the CDC, inside the NIH, And I've mentioned that. I've been told that a few weeks ago. But now we see the incredible news in Congress last Friday where Fauci admitted that around half of the individuals that work for the NIH and CDC- both of which are doctors and scientists and epidemiologists and virologists and nurses- research scientists- are not taking the so-called vaccines. that are really franken shots. So now, when you have the director of the CDC and the head of immunology and infectious disease is stepping down, this is seismic. But remember what happened in late 2019, when the UN had an emergency meeting in Switzerland and we played those clips on air at a two-day symposium and said: our front lines wobbly. our doctors and scientists say the vaccines aren't being tested, Big Pharma just gives them to us. We're doing illegal testing on third world populations and the public knows that people are getting hurt. They know about neurological disorders and we've got a major problem in our hands. We wrote big articles about it at the time. that was in January 2020. when we found out about it. We basically broke the news because listeners sent us the tips. Good job, listeners. Those compilations up until that point were the biggest vaccine news in the history of vaccinations. The head of the UN program saying: our frontline medical workers and doctors are wobbly. They know these vaccines are untested, They're hurting people. The House of Cards is coming down And unfortunately, those bombshell videos only got a few hundred thousand views. The new reports we're putting out are getting millions and millions, and millions. That's why I'm asking all of you watching and listening already on TV, right now, to go to Band-Aid video and go to the links under this report where you'll find those reports from January of 2020.. Ultimately, those who are not vaccinated will end up paying the price. So when Biden tells you that those of you that haven't taken this experimental Frankenstein are going to be paying for it, it's more than a threat. It's an inversion of reality. Every day I see hundreds of articles where young people die of heart attacks or strokes, or old people die of heart attacks or strokes or their lungs just fill up with blood. And that's what was in the UT studies and others years ago when they made COVID family vaccines and SARS family vaccines. Because, again, the protein in the virus shell is very close to the protein in our lungs, in our hearts, in our arteries, in our veins, in women's uteruses and in our brains. but I'm digressing. The reason this is so massive is they're in full panic mode because it's their own scientists that are saying no. the former chief scientist at Pfizer went public last year and predicted everything that's happening: Dr Edon, the head of one of the main private advisory boards that officially advises the EU, Wolfgang Wudard. Dr Wudard went public and predicted all of this from the literature, But now we don't just have the predictions, we have it all happening in live time. and the system trying to gaslight us is not working. It's waking up more people than they're able to actually brainwash and target. Now they're moving into the pure intimidation phase, where they're going to try to use corporate power, which is what globalism is. world government by corporate, fascist China's the model to force you to have a vaccine, to go to a game or to get it on an airplane or to have a certain job. But all of it violates the Nuremberg Code. all of it violates common sense. It'd be illegal to try to make you take a normal, truly tested vaccine. This is a gene therapy that they couldn't get approved for decades around the world, until the hysteria of COVID-19.. This is a biotech, genetic engineering revolution against humanity, And now they are purging the military of nationalists, of constitutionalists, and forging the military into the tip of the spear under the United Nations program. Remember last year where their head of global crisis response said: we're going to go into your homes, forcibly test you and take your children away. They've already beta tested that in some areas of Europe, Australia and even New York City. where a woman didn't want to mask on the streets, they took her kids. Remember that. And so that's the excuse to start disappearing people. And anytime they want, they can turn up the PCR test. Like Biden said: oh, if you don't all take it, COVID will come back. All they did was turn the PCR test from 40 cycles down to 29,, knowing that would give you almost all false negatives. Turn it up the other way: you get nothing but false positives. That's the math. That's what the inventor of the PCR test said. So now, whether you're in Texas or whether you're in California or New York, they have regular army, they have National Guard- you name it- going out, coming into shops and basically, with peer pressure, intimidating people, to have nonmedical personnel give you this experimental gene therapy on the side of the road. Here's some footage from Dallas last night. This is the first time we're doing it. Do you read that? One, two, three. Well, Johnson and Johnson. he only needs one and done. That's the good thing about it. You don't have to get a second one up like that. Yeah, that's it, And you have this pump with a second appointment, like you usually would buy it here, and all that stuff. Hey, bro, how do you feel that? you got this shot right here at work by US soldiers? My man, I take care of you many years. And while all of this is happening, the entire global corporate media, academia, Hollywood and local governments that are controlled by the Democrats have ganged up on people and try to intimidate them and say they're bad if you don't take this illegal shot, when the majority of the CDC and NIH owned doctors have refused to take the vaccine. And now, just today, Sweden says they've had 30,000 adverse reactions in their national reporting system to these so-called vaccines, more than the last decade, combined of all their other bad reactions, And we're seeing similar numbers here. So what does the corporate media do? They enlist comedians like Trevor Noah and John Oliver and others to come out and make fun of people that point this out. That does not make people feel bad about themselves. It makes them hate the individuals that are trying to suppress them. Why is all of this happening? Because power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely, And because powerful corporations have gotten together. in 1949, put Mao Zedong into power to build China up as the model of a fusion of capitalism and communism, which is really just neo-feudalistic, surfed them, And they need to bring America and Europe down and Australia down and New Zealand down. They need to get rid of these hard fought, hard won liberties and make us all live basically as surf slaves under them. So they have to take our freedoms and bring in this global social credit score that New York and others are implementing and the UK is implementing right off of Xi Jinping's plan, because it's not Xi Jinping's plan, It's Big Tech's plan. that's been involved the whole time, Not just bullying but censoring and suppressing the truth. They've all got conflict of interest. They're all making money off these deadly shots. Big pharma and Big Tech have merged and they're making their move against us to overwrite and overturn and abolish all of the basic freedoms that make us Americans. They are clear and present dangers. They are a threat to all of our freedoms, but also our very lives. This is a depopulation agenda. The good news is, whether you're on the street or whether you're looking at the polls. humanity's not buying President Biden. They know he stole the election. They know he's a front man for Obama. They know Obama's a front man. And people know that these aren't regular vaccines. They know this is a very wicked, evil agenda. They know people that have gotten sick or died. And so all of us have to make that decision: Are we going to let the sun be setting on their globalist takeover, on their corruption, Or is the sun setting on everything that our ancestors fought and died for, The basic decency, the basic freedoms that we have? These corrupt politicians are nothing more than globalist puppets, And when they tell you that they're giving you your freedom by letting you leave your house or have your job, when they're telling you that you're not essential, they are engaged in an attempt to steal your birthright. They didn't give us these freedoms. These freedoms aren't privileges. These are things that we innately have because we're made in the image of God. Government isn't our God. God is our God, because that puts we, the people, above government, with only God above us. The sun is setting on the New World Order. It was destined to fall from the beginning of its construction. The globalists are post-human exterminists. They literally want to extinct humanity and marginal machines. They're megalomaniacs, But we have to stand up for ourselves, We have to stand up for our children. We have to claim this birthright in our hands And let the globalists know we will never submit to their anti-human tyranny. One of the most common questions I get on air, but also off air when I'm just out and about, is Alex, what do I say to my family about the vaccines? How do I warn them? Well, the problem is there's so many problems with it. so many facts. It's the history of contaminated vaccines, The fact that they have liability protection in the US and Europe, The fact that they've been caught adding sterilants and cancer viruses and other things to vaccines, And the whole history of secret experimentation on at-risk groups of poor blacks, poor whites, Native Americans. The list goes on and on. But what about the fact that Fauci testified to Congress, and so did the head of the CDC, in late May of 2021, that around half of the NIH CDC staff, medical doctors or all just scientists, have refused to take the vaccine and don't think it's safe? Yeah, I think what? half of the doctors are scared to take it. That's the same thing in the private practices out there- similar numbers, that that's not something I'm going to be taking.

Ladies and gentlemen, there are audits happening in multiple states right now for the 2020 election, And it is turning up some interesting scents, some interesting dust floating in the air here. Let me just read you this stack of news on the audit front: Truth versus fiction, a comparison between Maricopa County Board of Supervisors audits and the Senate audit. Ultimately, there's no comparison And basically the story is: the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors don't want the audit. They've been trying to stop the audit. In fact, they may have actually now stopped the audit, Whereas the law says that the Senate can do their own audit, and the Board of Supervisors audit said: oh no, nothing to see here, but they wouldn't release their actual audit. And the Senate audit is finding stuff up left and right, but then they're getting blockaded once they get to things like signature verification. So they're definitely covering up the theft of Arizona, And now it appears the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors is complicit in that, And so now the Maricopa County will not be responding to any more requests regarding the audit, openly inviting legal action to be taken against them. And it was again the Board of Supervisors that did this, and their spokesman, Jack Sellers, said that the whole thing is a scam. Well, if it's a scam, what are you so worried about? Then let the audit happen and then call it a scam once nothing's been found. Oh no, you're the scam artist. You stole the election from the people of Arizona. The Gateway Pundit Reporter confronts Soros-backed Maricopa County Sheriff after his meltdown over router request. Now, remember they have chain of custody problems and then it turned out they had basically third party equipment leaving the scene collecting data leaving the scene. that night They tried to get those mobile hard drives for the audit. They were not allowed that. Arizona GOP Chairwoman Kelly Ward. Maricopa County Supervisors are going to ignore legislative subpoenas and will be held in contempt of Arizona's Senate authority. So Kelly Ward continuing to fight the good fight there in Arizona with a smile on her face, Mind you, I would be screaming and breaking things. They're worried. CNN moves into full propaganda mode, uses far left expert hired by Katie Hobbs and George Soros-funded Sheriff in hit piece on Arizona audit. Yeah, and so they have this guy. oh yeah, they bring him on. he's a technology expert. we're just pulling on here and this isn't rigged. And their guy Ryan Macias- no, he's one of the henchmen, He's in on the steal. Maricopa County officials ban Gateway Pundit Reporter Jordan Conradson from a public meeting and then block all entrances. Nothing to see here In New Hampshire. Wyndham audit team will look at New Hampshire's US Senate race this week after finding local GOP candidates consistently shorted votes. So yeah, you the vote audit New Hampshire turning up some interesting things. We now know one of the parties responsible for them- stealing the state of Georgia from America- and Donald Trump. It's going to be Lieutenant Governor Jeff Duncan, who has been spending a lot of his time recently on CNN bashing Trump saying he didn't win Georgia. There was no election fraud. Yeah, that's, he's doing that on CNN. I think we know where his loyalties lie. Pennsylvania County judge says Republican ballots cannot be scanned. What Pennsylvania County is experiencing issues? scanning Republican ballots during local elections and primary races, according to officials. Huh, All too convenient. Those ballots that I guess we're supposed to be for Trump? I don't know. Are they just taking your Republican ballot and just changing the votes and then saying, oh, we can't scan it? I don't know what's going on? Who knows? They won't tell you. Just don't. just who cares? Just let them steal elections from you and give it to people that can't walk or talk or swing a golf club. Maricopa County Board of Supervisors and Soros Back Sheriff, beg Arizona Senate to end election audit for the good of the country. Wow, For the good of the country, let's have more secrecy. Let's have less transparency. Let's have everybody thinking the election was rigged. Yeah, that's for the good of the country. Now, obviously, for the good of yourselves. you know you committed crimes and stole this election. Your voice counts when you share information, be it over the Internet or in person. it changes the world. The globalists know their agenda is unpopular. They know you're angry.

You're listening to the Alex Jones show and now your host, Owen Troyer. Here we are in the third hour of the Alex Jones show And Leo Zagami is joining me live on the air. And you know, Leo is an expert on all things: the Vatican, the history of the Vatican and the shadow societies that run it, and their history as well. So what happens is I'm just like a speed racer and, just you know, news and information is on the right side and the left side of the highway that I'm just racing down, And any time I see just crazy, shocking news come out of the Vatican, it's just like, oh my gosh, because I don't understand it like Leo does. I'm like, oh my gosh, I've got to get Leo on to explain this to me. But then I'm still flying down the road at 200 miles an hour And then by the time I turn around, I'm like, hey, what was that news? It's way out of my sight. So, Leo, I don't even remember what it was, but I know, you'll know, there's big news coming out of the Vatican. It's always weird, creepy stuff. Leo Zagami joins me now leozagamicom. What is the latest? as we see the world turning and the global tyranny coming in and just all these other new world order operations coming to the fore. The Vatican obviously highly involved, but it's not really making headlines lately. What's going on there in the Vatican? It's awfully quiet, awfully suspiciously quiet, if you ask me. It's been a suspiciously quiet Iowan for those who of course, don't know of Vatican matters, because actually the last few weeks have been the busiest ever in the Vatican. First of all, we had a special meeting, conducted in a remote modality- like conferences I heard these days- dedicated to the mind, body and soul, which featured as a special guest Dr Fauci. That's what it was. Fauci was going to the meetings at the Vatican. There it is. I knew, see it's folks. it's Leo Zagami, And there wasn't only Fauci there. To tell you the truth, Fauci was only one of the many people because we had Chelsea Clinton that was actually talking against social networks that permit criticism of the vaccine or anybody criticizing the vaccine. We had Depak Chopra, We had many other people. So it was quite a busy meeting that went on for three days. It was conducted by the group that the guy who is the head of the medical side of things at CNN. Then there was, of course, the guys at CBS, the ABC. So for a meeting of these proportions. there was an extremely low coverage after in the mainstream media. Hold on, Let me get this straight. Let me get this straight. So you had Fauci, Chelsea Hubble, Clinton- Did I hear you say that Indian guru Chopra was there too? They were. And then CBS and CNN people. So they all come to the Vatican to say we all must take the vaccine, Don't question it, Take the vaccine, You're bad if you question it. Well, I mean, the title of the conference is pretty hilarious: Exploring the mind, body and soul. And introducing the conference was, of course, Monsignor Ravasi, who is one of the people in charge of the Vatican Masonic lodges- by the way, He's actually a Freemason- And the first guest was Dr Fauci. And Dr Fauci started by talking about the fact that initially they had to rely on faith and not on science when they didn't know much about the virus. That was a complete lie, But of course, then he went on with more lies. And this conference was sponsored by a foundation, the John Temperter Foundation, which promotes contraception, And they gave $750,000 to the Vatican for this conference, which was hold on Zoom. basically, I think there is that much expenses when you are on Zoom, And then you had one point that this was the most. I mean. you can find the videos of this conference on a very unknown channel on YouTube And, in fact, watching it live, they were like up to 12 to 15 people With all these important guests. there was nearly nobody following it And basically it wasn't even in the official Vatican YouTube channel. It was on a channel opened by the big pharma for the event, And participating in the event was also Francis Collins. Now, Francis Collins and Anthony Fauci financed the creation of Humanized Mice, which is basically experimented at the University of Pittsburgh with the grant which was encouraged by Dr Fauci. So he's not really in line with Catholicism, but neither were people like Depeche opera, who wrote a book against the vision that the church has of Jesus Christ, with his own version of things. And then there was Joe Perry. Joe Perry, the guitarist of Ariosmith. Now, this was the most hilarious part of the conference because he was asked about the positive effects of cannabis and psychedelics. At that point I was watching this thing and I was asking to myself: this is the Pontifical Academy. He's in front of the Pope, even if remotely, and he's showing himself with an open shirt, a big chain, Talking about psychedelics and cannabis. I was a little bit perplexed, to tell you the truth, Owen, about this conference And, of course, it indulged in more hypocrisy by the Vatican, which, just a few days ago, saw the Pope growing to a pro-nativity event in Italy because of the low nativity that Italy, as most Western countries, has. And then we have instead the fact that he has received, like I said, a sponsorization by Foundation Promoting Court Reception. And on top of that, last month there was a big scandal because Libero Milone, who used to be the auditor general of the Vatican, that for 20 years, up until 2015,, the Vatican invested in two companies that were fabricating the day after pill, which is basically a form of abortion. So the Vatican is really on top of all hypocrisy. And then we had also another event, though that took place last Friday, with John Kerry, And this event was not only remote, It was actually also held with various conferences in person, And it was a very important event because they canceled the yearly event of the World Economic Forum And they, very much in secret, they transferred the whole of Davos to the Vatican. So we had various finance ministers, We had John Kerry, We had- remotely intervening- also Yellen, so from the US Treasury, And it was basically, like Schwab and Davos Solitta, taken over the Vatican in this meeting that nobody heard about because nobody was allowed to attend it And it was close to the press. It was not relayed live on the Vatican news and media channels as its customary. So here we are with a top secret meeting which, though, happened- It was confirmed also by my friend Jules Gomez, a church militant- But it wasn't really spoke about anywhere. And it's I mean, John Kerry should tell us. what did he go and do in a foreign country? because the Vatican is a country in itself, No, it's a sovereign country. So what was he talking with the Pope about? Well, they were talking about the Great Reset. So it seems like the Vatican has taken on board the business of the Great Reset And, this year, has substituted the meeting that was moved from Singapore to the Vatican. And this is, of course, because the Vatican, at the moment, is at the center of this New World Order, At the center of this sanitary dictatorship, with Dr Fauci, who is a Jesuit student, but also somebody who teaches at the Jesuit University. And let's remember to all our American viewers: this is the second time in history you have a Catholic president in the White House. Now you have the Jesuits in charge of your future and nobody still seems to understand the importance. And isn't the Pope the first Jesuit Pope, or the first to come from a Jesuit scholar academy? Absolutely yes. He's the first Jesuit Pope in history, because the Jesuits never had a Pope. They had a rule that forbid Jesuits to become Pope because then the Jesuits have to take an oath to the Pope. So now that the Pope- But Leo, we've got to take a break here. It will come back, but it's just incredible to see The Vatican. it's like they're not even trying to promote Jesus or the Bible or anything anymore. It's just all New World Order stuff. Well, in that event, I took: Yeah, we'll continue this. We've got to take a break, Leo Zagami, LeoZagamicom. When it hit number one a few years ago. it's now available again.

I'm not going to say this five times in a row to be obnoxious. I'm saying it because it's the key to victory over these criminals. Last week, the arch-globalist Fauci admitted that roughly half of the CDC's top morass and workers- medical doctors, scientists, nurses, you name it- have taken the so-called COVID-19 Frankenstein. I'm going to say it the second time: Around half of the doctors at the CDC and NIH refuse to take the Franken shots. They don't trust it. You shouldn't trust it. The vaccines have been banned in most countries around the world. This is an attack on the American people and the people of the world. This is an absolute red flag smoking gun. Again, let me say it two more times: Around half of the individuals that work at the NIH and CDC, the medical staff, refuse to take the vaccines. That's right. The doctors, nurses, scientists- do not trust a so-called vaccine, And you shouldn't either. You're listening to the Alex Jones Show Here. Info Wars is live. It's the Alex Jones Show, Owen Schroyer with you, Leo Zagami, our guest from leozagamicom Boy. what is the Vatican up to now, Completely abandoning the Holy Bible, completely abandoning the gospel, abandoning the word of Christ, abandoning Jesus Christ, abandoning God for all intensive purposes and now taking a knee to the New World Order, taking a knee to the Mark of the Beast. I mean, Leo Zagami. we saw them take one of the most incredible, holiest fixtures for Christians and Catholics in Brazil, Christ the Redeemer Statue, and put vaccine saves on it. No, Jesus Christ saves is what you should be putting on it, And they put vaccine saves on it. What a telling image that is, as you have Fauci and John Kerry and other globalists meeting with the Pope discussing how it's time to turn humanity over to the one world order beast we're warned about in the Bible. instead of warning the world of the New World Order Mark of the Beast, they're promoting it. Leo Zagami And John Kerry, who is the climate envoy for the Biden administration, said in an interview with Vatican News that he thinks that Pope Francis is one of, if not the most powerful voice on the planet, And he said also that he identifies as a practicing Catholic. So the skull and bones, John Kerry is also a practicing Catholic. That means that basically, the White House is in control of the Jesuits, like I said, of the Catholics, but not the good Catholics, not the good side of Catholicism. That went out of the window with the Second Vatican Council and definitely this Pope doesn't represent it. We have a Monsignor, big another, every now and then talks. Now yesterday we had also received Erdogan calling Pope Francis, because, of course, he's the most powerful voice on the planet, so he needs to talk with him Now. he incited him to punish Israel for its attacks against Palestine. He's mobilizing the Christian world and the international community. That's what he said. I'm quoting Erdogan. So we are now, right now, in a moment of time in which the Vatican wants to also break some kind of deal between the Palestinians, Hamas and Israel. So they are also offering to act as mediators, as diplomats. So, as you see, they are very central to what is going on today in the world. Almost everything that we speak about goes through the Vatican. You know, Leo. here's the problem, As I see that video of those Brazilian women doing a salute to the vaccine saves on the Christ the Redeemer statue there in Rio de Janeiro, which I mean it's one of the greatest things I've been there. It's just such a magnificent thing. the statue, the sites. it's just so beautiful. There's a little church under it as well You can go pray in, and I see these women saluting it. And so it's more than just the overturn of God the Creator and Christ the Savior into fallen man, But it's using the propaganda and using people's genuine will to do something good. I mean these girls probably think, oh, we're doing something good, Everybody get on board. It's the vaccine, Like if we just come together and they don't understand because they're not being taught the Bible, Satan deceives them. Man is fallen, Man can be influenced by Satan. And so I get it. You want to trust everybody. You want to be a collectivist part of the team, like who raw know people are deceiving you. And so it breaks my heart to see this. These girls will probably line up to get the vaccine and half of them will probably never be able to have a kid, Leo. And I mean it's just, it's unbelievable to witness this. I mean seriously, it's shocking to see how people are praising their own destruction. We saw during the Easter period in Rome. they use the dove as a symbol for vaccination, The Holy Spirit to promote the vaccination. And Dr Fauci said: use religion to fight vaccine a version. So he said it, Dr Fauci. So I mean, we are, of course, in watching a church which is instrumental to the New World Order, A church that no longer is in line with Christ, with Christianity, And it's acting on behalf of this one world religion. That's why they invited all these new age gurus, Buddhist Sufis, at this conference. Didn't they actually have a conference prior to that that? they did invite a bunch of other world religion leaders And they like, even done it like a one world religion They have. basically, we have seen a lot of things happening this year in March. We have seen the pope going to Iraq and in Iraq he met with the representatives of the Shiite Muslims and the Sunni And everybody was agreeing that they were moving towards something new And that something new will be showed, probably in Astana- North sultanate is known- now next year, when the pope will visit the city in Kazakhstan where they will hold some kind of the one world religion summit, which is something I prophesized, by the way, in my Pope Francis last pop question book a long time ago. So all of your books, very prophetic. I wonder if we still have copies of those. at infowarsstorecom, We've been selling Leo Zagami's book for a long time. But here's what the one world religion really is, Leo. to me This is just a story. An example: church of Sweden announces that it is trans. Okay, And so the new one world religion is your identity. The new one world religion is: what's in my pants? What do I want to be in my pants? What's my skin color? What's my virtue signal? Do I wear my mask? Have I taken my vaccine? The new one world religion is virtue signal for whatever is hot that day, Whatever you identify at that day, whatever's in your pants, whatever sex you have. that's the new religion, not the creator, Absolutely. I mean. these days, the LGBT community is very much in line with what Pope Francis is doing, But at the same time, we have a lot of hypocrisy from the church, because let's remind our viewers that the church these days, the clergy of the church, is constituted 80% by homosexuals. So if they all came out and showed their real sexuality, probably they will be more in line with something that is condemned by Christ in the sense that is condemned by the Bible as a sodomy. Now we of course want to be Christian and forgive everybody and be tolerant, But the fact is that they are taking over the church and they are using it instrumentally for their own pro-LGBT agenda. That's what it is. There is more and more preletes who are pro-LGBT. In Australia just lately, we had the case of a prelete promoting the LGBT community, And then we have many other cases around the world. It's the old: if you can't beat them, join them. The left, the communists, have always hated churches. They've always hated really religious people, And so now they just figured: well, let's just join it and then corrupt it, and then it'll fall in on itself, And I'm seeing this everywhere. I went to a church. If there's a church in your area that is openly promoting homosexuality or something you know, it's not a church, It's a front. That's all it is. Well, the most horrific phrase spoken by our Lord is, for me: you accursed ones into the eternal fire, which was prepared for the devil and his angels, And we go back to what a long time ago. Let's do one more segment with Leo Zagami. You don't go anywhere. I'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off the successes and full versus that. If you're paying attention, you know we've done together. But I'll tell you this: The technocrats are really upping their game and they are trying to destroy all independent forms of media. They're trying to shutter and silence the human resistance. So now is the time to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate. Everything you warned your friends and family about is about to be true. So it's now that your credibility is way up. The power structures are to silence those of us that they can't, But it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us. We have the power, But the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech. We have to make sure that we fight hard right now to make sure that a long, dark night doesn't come. So be the color of yours. you are Thanks for watching. Listen up, patriots. I'm running a sale that's the biggest I've ever run, on three products that are already selling out. Well then, why am I selling it then, at 50% off or 60% off, depending on which sale you go with? Because I know a lot of you are on the fence.

Go to infowarstorecom. We're running this Monday through Sunday and the deal is over- Best deal ever. take advantage of it at infowarstorecom and fund the info war. We're running this Monday through Sunday. We're running this Monday through Sunday. We're listening to the Alex Jones show. It's hard to turn off the Rolling Stones. Rolling Stones are nothing compared to those talents. Ladies and gentlemen, by the way, I've got still a bunch of news stacks here that I'm not even probably going to be able to get to. on the Alex Jones show, Paul Joseph Watson is coming up. I will be hosting the war room as well, coming up at 3 pm, filling my normal duties there. I've got some news. I'm just going to have to build it up. I'm not even going to try to tease it right now. But let's just say, the January 6 fake insurrection narrative is about to get some major steam behind it, A major windfall coming in for that narrative. So I'm just going to leave it at that and then I'm going to cover that coming up on the war room And I got some other news here. but I got Leo Zagami with me now And so, Leo, I don't know if you want to get back to what we were talking about, but I kind of just want to get your take on anything or everything right now that's going on. I mean, you've written books about this. you've been coming on Info Wars for years. We've known a lot of this is coming And because of that, now that I'm like in it, Leo, I'm almost like numb. I'm almost like numb to the whole thing. now you know like Nova Cane time or something. So, Leo, pick it up where you left off. or just what do you see happening in the world? What do you think comes next? I mean, does it get any crazier than what we see now? Is the Renaissance, Is the awakening now gaining momentum? Is the New World Order too powerful, Leo Zagami? But first of all let's go back to Mick Jagger and the Rolling Stones, because Mick Jagger just released a song talking about all these topics, Quite critical of the sanitary dictatorship. I was so glad about that. And then I mean Van Morsen did one too. So it's nice to see some of these rock stars that probably normally would tow the party line, coming out against the tyranny. That's what rock and roll used to be about, Leo. Yes, and it needs to go back to that, Otherwise it's just going to be conforming with the world, with the world, one world government and their ideology. unfortunately, They are saying they're dreaming for a better start in the Vatican. Even Dave Grohl, who's like a hardcore Democrat, like even he's against the tyranny. So that's nice. Well, people are starting to wake up and actually from the left, gradually, I think that more and more people are going to realize all the freedom we have lost and all these crazy impositions that every day we are seeing from the sanitary dictatorship. So we are living in unprecedented times And of course, like we said earlier, communism, Marxism, is taking over even the Catholic faith, aside from having taken over the Democratic Party, which is now the party of the leftist extremist. So worldwide we have this tendency to promote Marxism, basically because I think the new generations have forgot what communism did to us. You see, the people who have now 20, 30 years old. they have 20, 30 years old. they don't know how evil communism was, And I think they need to study it a little bit more. But unfortunately, that's not going to happen because at the moment, wherever you go, you have the promotion of socialism and Marxism. Hugo Chavez said that Jesus Christ was the biggest socialist of all time, And that is what they are trying to promote. That is Hugo Chavez, But no, but it's like. it's like what they did with Netflix and they said: oh look, Jesus is gay. Well, but then you see that Netflix then lost a lot of viewers and Netflix is going down the drain. Yeah, I got rid of my Netflix as soon as they had the cutie pedophile film on there. That was it for me. Yes, I mean, they do this kind of extreme leftist turnovers and then after they lose support because people can take only so much of this propaganda, and then they react in some way. So I think that the tradition needs to stay there And at the same time, we are seeing- I don't know if you have discussed this, but for me it's important because he's also related to me some way. Prince Harry criticizing the First Amendment? Oh, hold on a second. You can't just say something like that and expect me to pass over it. Did you just say you think you're related to Prince Harry? No, I am related to Prince Harry. You may never be allowed on these airwaves again. if this is true, I want a DNA test, But hold on, you know, I might as well do it now. My grandfather was the cousin of the Queen, Mother Elizabeth Bowles Lyon. Okay so, but is that the? is that Princess Diana's line? No, that's the line, basically, of Prince Charles. So you may not be related then. I'm serious. Look, I'm not trying to be conspiratorial. Prince Harry may actually be a love child between Princess Diana and her horse trainer. That I know. In fact, you know it looks very much like him. Everybody knows that, Which would get you off the hook, Leo. I don't want you to be a British royal. Listen, I don't really get on that well with my family, especially the British side of my family, So it's like they are way too pompous for me. I grown up around them. You're an American now, Leo. Yes, absolutely, Absolutely. That's why I'm really annoyed to see somebody like Prince Harry leaving, like me, here in California and criticizing the First Amendment, saying it's bonkers. I mean, I find it extremely disturbing that a guy like this comes here and criticize the First Amendment. I mean, Americans have fought for their constitution and 776 is definitely still the answer to 1984, which is something that, by the way, was a book that was born in Great Britain. George Orwell was British, and we have already, back in those days, people like George Orwell, HG Wells, Huxley saying that we were going towards this kind of world, But now that we have it in front of us, well, we can say that even Great Britain is really an oppressed population at the moment. I mean, I'm glad that I am here in the US and I'm not living in Europe, I'm not living in Great Britain, So it makes me very happy to know that I have still a possibility of talking freely without having somebody breaking through my door, like it happened in Italy and like it will happen if I was also in England, because they don't have any freedom of press or freedom of expression. Yeah, you look at Julian Assange, or you look at Tommy Robinson. I mean, the list just goes on. But I mean seriously, though, where do you think this comes from? Does he have no concept of history? Is he that ignorant? Was he told to say it? I mean, where does he get off saying the First Amendment is bonkers? I don't believe in free speech. I mean, what the hell, man? They live in a parallel reality. You see, filled with echo chambers that make them feel they're saying the right thing all the time. But do you think it should? I mean it really. it should show the world their mindset. They really don't believe that you have freedom, Like they really don't believe you, the individual, have freedom or can self govern. They had a foreign concept to them. Yeah, and there is a lot of things that people forget about this royal family. I mean, Prince Harry was going around 30, 20 years ago, I remember, with his Nazi symbol, at a party dressed up as a Nazi, And we know that his family supported the Nazis in the past. I think he was just reenacting some of his families, some of his lineage history actually. Well, actually there is a little small video of the queen. She was still a child. They were all giving the Nazis a loot. So I mean they were very much supportive of Adolf Hitler. I'm fortunate not part of that part of the family, which is the Hanoverian part. You see, there is part of the family that comes from Germany. I don't come from that part of the family. Leo, where can people follow your great work and find your books? I think they're still available at infowarstorecom, but where's all your great articles? Well, you can always go on leozagamicom and you have all the links to my latest books on leozagamicom. And thank you for having me on again here on Infowars. It's always a pleasure. And are you still doing YouTube videos, Leo? Yes, though they are constantly removed. That's why I'm not seeing them. They're banning, Leo. Unbelievable. All right, ladies and gentlemen, another segment of the Alex Jones show on the other side. Thank you so much, Leo. Thank you, That's right. Joe Biden shut down the Keystone Pipeline right after it was completed. Joe Biden did that to America. He has the history, He has the background. He's the one that promised, to quote, get us off of fossil fuels. He's the one that's tried to extend the lockdowns of the country. Remember, ladies and gentlemen, that the New World Order wants a post-industrial world, And they want the United States, Europe and Australia crippled so communist China can be dominant.

We have such a complex civilization with so many billions of moving parts that when you shut down the first world, it causes a chain reaction that will devastate the third world and really hurt the first world. Well, now you're hearing about gas shortages all over the United States. That's because the companies and the systems and the drivers that could barely get the job done before delivering gas had been shut down. Plus, the Keystone Pipeline's been shut down, along with other pipelines. The left is now blowing up dams across the US. We're being shut down. Our coal power plants are off as well. Ladies and gentlemen, prepare to be a total slave. The third world is imploding as well. The borders have been removed. Until you wake up- and this is a globalist chai-com takeover- Gregory said you have no hope. They're announcing that there will be less than two-thirds of the gas needed this summer. So they told you that you're under lockdown one way or another, and CNN laughed at you and your family. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. President Joe Biden isn't an exceptional person. They're a liar. Who have you ever seen who can fall upstairs? Who have you ever seen that can actually hit a golf ball backwards behind them by hitting it forwards? And who Who can get crowds of only five or six people to rally but still get nine million more votes than Barack Obama and President Trump? Yes, only the incredible Joe Biden can do this. And also a sidekick for every Batman there's a robin. We have Anthony Fauci. Dr Fauci, Hi, Dr Fauci, Of course, does a great job of throwing baseballs into home play. Yes, we have Fauci now to always kick off our national best time for throwing in the first ball. The latest from Alex Jones on a working vacation. You don't look. I got all this news to get to and I'm going to focus here, but I just got to tell you and I'm curious, maybe too, and maybe we should just take calls on this someday. We'll take a lot of calls tomorrow, by the way. we're hearing now that major corporations like Home Depot and others, starting tomorrow, are going to force their employees to be vaccinated or tell them to be relieved of their duty. This is going to lead to all kinds of lawsuits. It's totally illegal. So that's going to be a major story. So, if you're experiencing that, we're going to open up the phone lines on the first two hours of tomorrow's Alex Jones show to hear from you and what you're hearing. But I don't know. The developments that are happening right now are almost- I said to Leo Zagami- numbing but almost calming in a way. Not that Info Wars has fulfilled its destiny, but it's like we've already launched our course. The New World Order has already launched their course and there's no steering away from it and collision is eminent, which means they're done. Yeah, we're probably going to be blown up and exploded and destroyed with them, but they'll be done. It's like at the end of the movie Prometheus, when the alien death ship is taking off and the captain is like with the lady, the astronaut on the ground. she's like you can't let that ship go. And the crew's like this isn't a military ship, This is a transport ship. And the captain's like I know, you know what that means. So it's like collision is eminent and they're totally exposed. their whole New World Order operation, the medical tyranny, all of it, it's being rejected. People are standing up and fighting back. It's a great thing to see, But again, you know that evil is still there. You know the execution is still there. You know that the plans are still being executed And you see all the people dying from the vaccine and all the side effects and they're going to mandate it now and they're going to have the vaccine. So I mean, again, we're on a collision course with this. There's no turning back, There's no steering away. They can't change path, We can't change path And so as long as they're destroyed, our mission will be complete. But there's almost a calming sensation, like you know. yep, you realize you're about to blow up in the ship that takes down the death ship. But you know what? that's okay because that was what you were meant to do anyway. So it's kind of calming and numbing, But you still know there's going to be a lot of catastrophe and suffering in the interim. And you know what, maybe it's not so bad, Maybe we've got it so good here compared to our ancestors that it won't be so bad, But then again maybe it'll be worse than ever, And so I guess that's kind of the mystery element. But let me just stop waxing here and get to some of the rest of this news And then I'm going to hand it over to Paul Joseph Watson and then I'll be hosting the war room today as well. But, ladies and gentlemen, remember everything we do here is possible. Not just possible, but your support at infowarstorecom is necessary. Your word and telling friends and family about infowarscom is necessary. Now is the time, folks. The fruit is ripe, It's time to share it. You see all the people standing up. You see all the rallies, You see all the events, all the organizers, school boards, meetings- I mean children- standing up now. So I mean: info wars is the genesis of this. Info wars is the center hub of which this energy and desire to be free flows from. And then you know people who've never even heard of info wars or in the info war themselves, just for lack of a better term. show them the source, Show them the central hub. We need more people calling in. How many great callers do we have that? just give us unbelievable intelligence. just live on air. We're opening up the phones for two hours to start the show. tomorrow Is your company forcing you to be vaccinated? And then that was he. and then, once that happens and they have the vaccine cards and passports that are totally normalized, Then I think we're really going to start to know about the shedding and the side effects. I think we're really just starting to figure out what. what's going on with that. Once you know everyone at your job or something has been vaccinated, and then you're going around and you're hearing things, That's when I think we'll really know. but we'll need you to call in and share that with us as well. So this is how we work here And again, it's all possible with your supported info wars storecom. We want you to be healthy, not like Dr Fauci. You know someone shared a bunch of images from like the 70s and pictures at pools and beaches and they say, how come? how come? nobody is fat? You go to a beach or a pool- Now half the people there are morbidly obese- and say, how come? we've been under attack, ladies and gentlemen. The people of this country have been under attack from food corporations with bad food and GMOs and poison in the water, Poison in your drinks and sugar and high fructose corn syrup and all the rest of it. We don't want you to be like that, folks. That's why we sell all the great supplements at info wars storecom. So like survival shield X2 is just unbelievable. The nascent iodine and people have. you go read the thousands of five star reviews. You'll hear all kinds of different stories and testimonies about what happened to them after they took the survival shield X2.. All good, five star reviews, But it's just like when you give your body something that it's been demanding and needing for decades, potentially, and you kick your thyroid back into action. Yeah, you're going to see some crazy stuff. You're going to feel ways you haven't felt in years in a good way, And that's just one of the great products at info wars storecom. All right, What do I want to get to here. I'm going to have to hold over some of this news. I'll cover it on the war room, But look at what's happening now. This is going to become the new normal, I suppose, the pipelines being shut down, or the Democrats saying: we're going to shut your pipelines down. Are they going to continue to frame Russia? How are they going to roll this out? So remember, though, we're only a week away, a week removed from the sabotage of our pipeline. And, by the way, now reports- I've seen conflicting reports. Now reports are saying the hackers got $90 million in Bitcoin, And I remember I first reported that they were going to get paid in Bitcoin, And then people saying: where are you seeing that? How do you know that? I'm not seeing that. I was like again, it's like I'm just going 200 miles down the road. I don't have time to turn around and see where I saw something, and I can't turn around and drive around. I have a destination to be at. And then I saw breaking news today. They were saying: oh, they got paid $90 million in Bitcoin. So I don't know what's going on, But the point is, pipeline got shut down, We got lied to about it, And now that same pipeline, colonial pipeline. shippers are saying the communication system is down. So is this another hack? What is going on? So, yeah now. so originally they said again, I can't even tell you, it's all in the rear view, But originally it was: they got paid in Bitcoin- $5 million. Then it was: oh no, they didn't get paid in Bitcoin. And people are attacking me saying fake news. And now they're saying $90 million in Bitcoin. Bitcoin, by the way, has dipped about $10,000 since the hack. So I mean, I don't know, But now their communication system is down, And so who knows what's going on there? Meanwhile, gold gains as dollar goes red for 2021, lowest since 2024.. Oh, Biden is collapsing the dollar and then also printing more dollars, which will lead to a bigger collapse of the dollar and then hyperinflation. Of course, this is all by design, just like the pipeline shut down. Yeah, that's how it goes. Boy oh boy. there's so much I didn't get to. I'm going to do the first five minutes coming up in the next hour And then Paul Joseph Watson will be joining us. A couple of the news stories here: Governor Abbott is trying to save his skin before he's up for reelection, even though we know that he helped spike the bill to ban children from having transgender surgeries. I guess he's for chopping up little girls genitals. He got that one wrong. He got this one right. Governor Abbott issues executive order prohibiting government entities from acquiring masks in Texas, and they could be subject to a fine, Beautiful, Beautiful. Got to love that. And, by the way, to me this is just more evidence that Trump won in a landslide. You've got all kinds of Democrats with voter remorse, but every poll indicates Trump's policies are still populist And even Democrats don't believe the results of the 2020 election. And then there was another shocking poll: 91% of Democrats strongly approve of Biden. I think it was. 89% of Democrats strongly approve of Biden. 91% of Republicans strongly disapprove of Biden. I may have the numbers just off a little bit, but I mean that shows you the divide in our country right now. And of course, it's one side of the aisle being completely brainwashed by corporate media and the other side of the aisle that can think for themselves and do their own research. And again, we have the studies that prove that as well. One of the most common questions I get on air, but also off air when I'm just out and about, is Alex, what do I say to my family about the vaccines? How do I warn them? Well, the problem is there's so many problems with it. so many facts. It's the history of contaminated vaccines, the fact that they have liability protection in the US and Europe, the fact that they've been caught adding sterilants and cancer viruses and other things to vaccines. the whole history of secret experimentation on at-risk groups of poor blacks, poor whites, Native Americans- The list goes on and on. but what about the fact that Fauci testified to Congress, and so did the head of the CDC, in late May of 2021, that around half of the NIH CDC staff- medical doctors, neurologist scientists- have refused to take the vaccine until they can save- Yeah, I think what? half of the doctors are scared to take it. that's the same thing in the private practices out there somewhere. numbers that that's not something I'm going to be taking. That's very, very simple. There's your answer. Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left. It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept. If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from infowarstorecom. Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system. Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells. It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality. Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member or yourself at infowarstorecom. Let him who has understanding reckon the number of the beast, for it is a human number. Its number is 666.. All right, ladies and gentlemen, Paul Joseph Watson is about to take over here and I'm going to be back hosting the war room at 3 o'clock with a lot of big news that I didn't get to on The Jones Show. but real quick. And also, guys, can you clip 24 into the war room video folder for me please too? So look this Israel-Palestine, Hamas stuff. it's kind of the same thing to me from a show host perspective as the whole race issue, because I don't care about race in the same way, quite frankly, that I don't really care about Israel or Palestine. And so there's this weird thing where, if you say that like, oh my gosh, you don't care about Israel, like, oh my God, Okay, fine, that's my business, I don't care about Israel. You love Israel. You want Israel first. You're Jewish? Fine, Okay, good for you, Son of my business. You like Hamas, You like the wars constantly, You know, whatever that's son of my business. You just don't care, Just like I don't care about your skin color. And so it becomes this weird thing where it's like I cover these issues of racism and every day I'm like you know, why do you even cover it? Why do you even talk about it? I almost have like immediate regret. Same thing goes for this whole Israel-Palestine thing. The whole thing is a mess and, quite frankly, I don't care. Or, as John McAfee stated it: a bicycle for fish will come sooner than peace in the Middle East. But I'm starting to learn some things about the psychology here and the dichotomy. Now let me just give you some of the headlines here. Israel: airstrikes on Gaza resume as Tel Aviv thanks Biden administration for blocking UN statement calling for ceasefire. So Biden doesn't want to ceasefire. Where is the left? So there's a fraction in the Democrat Party there, Some of them like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilan Omar and Rashida Tlaib. they're on the kill all Jews side of history. So that's not really the side you want to be on- the kill all Jews side. But that's where half the Democrat Party is, And then I guess the other half of the Democrat Party that supports Biden. they don't want peace, They're against peace in the Middle East. So I mean there's no winning side there. The only winning side to me is just get out of it. This doesn't really help anybody's cause either. Again, I want everybody to get along. I'm not Muslim, I'm not Jewish And again, I don't plan on going to Israel or the Gaza Strip or any part of my life going there. You know, maybe if they were to figure stuff out I would, but no plan. So really don't care. Didn't fight in World War II, Didn't create Israel, Didn't have anything to do with any of those treaties, Don't know what Israel does for us. But then this doesn't help either. Mob smashes up Muslim YouTubers home for disrespecting Palestine. So in a way they have like a BLM Antifa element there. that's not just Hamas but just the street thugs. And then you have CNN hosts. What are the Israelis supposed to do? Brian Stelzer defends bombing of tower housing, AP and others. So Brian Stelzer, one of the dumbest potatoes in television history, but even he doesn't want to be on the side of death to all Jews. So that's an incredible thing. Now here's the psychology that I've realized. because I don't know Dave Rubin. I have no problems with Dave Rubin. His content seems to be good every time I see it. So I have no problems with Dave Rubin. Nick Fuentes I do know. I've met Nick many times. I would consider Nick a friend. I don't know him that well, but every time we've met we've been cordial and we have a good time. So Rubin is pro-Israel, Fuentes is America first, which means we're sick of Israel controlling our foreign policy. Well, Fuentes challenges Rubin to a debate on the issue and Rubin blocks him, blocks him. So, just like the left won't have a debate, conservatives won't have the Israel debate, which means that they really have no ground to stand on. Not a good look. but I think it's a generational thing. I think that- and I'm not trying to be age training, but I think that boomers and people that have relatives that were in World War II, versus young people my age 20s, 30s- we don't care about Israel. We don't. I'm sorry, I'm just telling you. we do not care about Israel, Unless you're Jewish, you have family in Israel. the average American that's under the age of 30 or 40 doesn't care about Israel. It's just the older people that seem to have this weird affection with it. Warning, warning, warning. The globalists have launched a massive counter-offensive against populist forces worldwide. They are censoring, they are attacking, they are arresting patriots all over the world. Churches in Europe, Australia, the UK and Canada, and even California and New York, are being swat-teamed and closed because they're non-essential. The tyranny is incredible, but in areas like Texas and South Dakota and Florida, where we have a history of more liberty, all the lockdowns are over. ladies and gentlemen, This is martial law. This has all been a massive martial law drill, and now it's more important than ever to spread the word about info wars and to support info wars. We have three of our best selling products selling out, but despite that, they're all massively discounted: Turbo Force- it's 40% off. We've got Ultimate Fish Oil 50% off, and Winter Sun for your immune system, It's 50% off as well. Best deal ever. Take advantage of it at infowarstorecom and fund the info war Transmitting Worldwide from the SummitNews studios in the United Kingdom. You are listening to Paul Joseph Watson And we're all live. It is the Summit News Hour and in a minute or two I'm going to go to a video that I put up yesterday which features a poll, and the true focus of the story isn't actually the poll, It's what's come out in the past few days as it pertains to how scientists advising the government in the United Kingdom back at the start, just before the start of the first pandemic, literally made the decision and then followed through on What they term psychological manipulation and quote mind control. They actually had behavioral psychologists come in and advise the government how to make people more frightened of COVID than what they should be compared to the actual threat that it represented. Now we've been saying this for over a year. We call conspiracy theorists, denialists, anti-vaxxers for doing so. Now it's come out literally in the United Kingdom over the past few days that the scientific dictatorship advised the government, based on what they termed mind control techniques to terrorize the public into going along with all these measures to get this first lockdown in place. Because, as we featured before, the top scientists behind the lockdown, behind the machinations of the lockdown model in the United Kingdom, Professor Neil Ferguson, the guy who, by the way, was later caught traveling across London in violation of lockdown, to meet and have sex with his married mistress because he thought it was that important. He went on record saying: we didn't believe that we could get away with what the Chinese, the communist Chinese, got away with during the imposition of their dictatorial lockdown. Now we have the same scientists literally admitting they use mind control techniques to brainwash, to hudwink the public into going along with it all. And this news story barely made a splash over the past few days. And the reason it's important is because we have this mask call, this COVID call, that refuses to relinquish their membership of that call, Which, for the mask call, is wearing this face, covering this face diaper as a high status symbol because, oh, they're part of the establishment, They're part of the scientific dictatorship. Let's not talk about the fact that the COVID virus particle is literally a thousand times smaller than the holes in that mask. They never want it to end. In fact, The New York Times came out with an article yesterday and they tweeted: they're vaccinated and keeping their masks on, maybe forever. And it quotes: somebody is saying: even if I'm the only person on the planet Earth that continues to wear the mask, if that's what makes me feel comfortable, I'll wear the mask. So they've literally reached the stage where even Dr Fauci now is admitting that it was theater to continue to tell people to wear the mask, even after they've received the much vaunted amazing vaccination. admitting it was all BS, admitting it was theater. Yet these cult mask members still insistent that not not just going to wear it for the summer, not just for the next year or so, not just through the winter flu season- even though flu's apparently disappeared- No, they're going to wear it forever. They've literally reached the point where Jim Jones is up on the stage telling him to all drink the Kool-Aid and they're going to go ahead right along with it. So we're going to get into this video, but first let's preface it with a headline out of Sputnik: Indian COVID-19 variant could scupper June 21st, end date for UK lockdown. So these mask zealots, these cult members, these COVID cult members, they've got one thin tiller of hope that they can cling on to for this to last forever, which is the dreaded Indian variant. Now, even on their own propaganda they say: well, the vaccine is entirely successful in stopping this Indian variant from spreading. Even the people who have caught this variant in areas of the UK like Bolton and Blackburn. it doesn't have serious effects, It doesn't require serious hospitalization in the vast majority of cases, But still these scientists who've been proven spectacularly wrong time and time again, with these theamongering models on COVID- half a million dead in the UK, for example- They're still clinging to it and saying no, not only do we end the 21st of June- complete release of restrictions, but we roll back the easing of restrictions that we've already had. I'm going to get into that after this video, though, because this really outlines the severity, the force of the propaganda that so terrorized the British public thus far. 10% of Brits want lockdown to continue forever. Here's the clip. We'll come back right after Let's roll it. A new poll finds that one in 10 Brits want lockdown measures to continue forever. Yeah, forever. The Sunday Times reports a study of almost 200,000 users of Cooth and online mental health forum found last week that 41% feel nervous every day. A separate study by the polling firm Opinion claimed that one in 10 Britons want lockdown restrictions to remain indefinitely. 10% of the population wants to remain under defacto house arrest, their movements, behavior, social life determined by government mandates which change all the time, And they want that to continue forever. The newspaper featured case studies of those who have been so terrorized by the perceived threat of COVID that they've developed a chronic form of agrophobia. Long before the emergence in India of a dangerous new COVID variant, Hailey Martin was worried about the easing of lockdown restrictions in Britain and the prospect of going out and interacting with people again. Oh, my God, the horror. The government's warnings last week of the new threat to the nation's health have redoubled her fears of leaving her home in Congleton, Cheshire. We've tried to go out but it's been really anxiety provoking and stressful. My imagination runs wild. Echoing that sentiment, a member of the sage government advisory body was asked what it would take for him to dare to visit a pub. Graham Medley said he'd only dare visit if it was- quote- suitably organized and it looked okay and was in an area of low prevalence and the clientele was very old and therefore mostly vaccinated. He sounds like a barrel of laughs. What was the catalyst to produce such weak and pathetic thinking? What could possibly have happened to generate such spineless jellyfish behavior? The poll conducted last summer found that the average Brit thought 100 times more people had died from coronavirus than the actual figure. Why do they think that? Could it have anything to do with the government being told by the scientific pandemic influenza group on behavior that they needed to increase- quote- the perceived level of personal threat from COVID-19 because- quote- a substantial number of people still do not feel sufficiently personally threatened. This scientific body admits using covert psychological manipulation techniques to coerce the public into total obedience and compliance. The people who admit that they deliberately amplified this fear now admit that it was- quote- unethical and totalitarian. Yeah, you admitted that a year too late. One of the scientists told a journalist- quote- in March 2020, the government was very worried about compliance and they thought people wouldn't want to be locked down. There were discussions about fear being needed to encourage compliance and decisions were made about how to ramp up that fear. The way we have used fear is dystopian. They even admit in their own words that they used- quote- mind control to manipulate the public- Again, their words, not mine- and that it was so successful that the public became too scared. Remember, this is the scientific body that advised the government on lockdown. These are not my words, These are their words. Remember Professor Neil Ferguson's admission when discussing the decision to impose lockdown based on the Chinese model. It's a Communist one-party state. we said We couldn't get away with it. in Europe, we thought. and then Italy did it And we realized we could Get away with. what, If it was so important to save lives? what were you getting away with? The Covid pandemic will eventually end, but the psychological impact of it will last for years afterwards, Large swathes of entire populations left traumatized, PTSD-ridden and pathologically shell-shocked, and yet also gelded, socially engineered, guaranteed to offer nothing but total compliance and groveling subservience whenever the next crisis comes along. I won't be back to discuss more on that very topic. This is the Summit News Hour. We'll be right back. Don't go away. And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us. for a lot of reasons, I can't tell you what's going on, but let's just say this: We're going to see this through to the end, where it's. stay on air as long as we can. So please pray for us and please buy the products, And then FullWareStorecom. They're great products. plus, they fund the operation. So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great. Do they fund freedom? No, a lot of them don't. These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth. That's why the globalists are censoring. They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air. So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word. Download everything we've done You can find and save it, because who knows how long we're going to be on the air and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said. I'm not going to say this five times on the road to the obnoxious. I'm saying it because it's the key to victory over these criminals. Last week, the Arch Globalist Fauci admitted that roughly half of the CDC's top brass and workers- medical doctors, scientists, nurses, you name it- have taken the so-called COVID-19 franken shot. I'm going to say it the second time: Around half of the doctors at the CDC and NIH refused to take the franken shots. They don't trust it. You shouldn't trust it. The vaccines have been banned in most countries around the world. This is an attack on the American people and the people of the world. This is an absolute red flag smoking gun. Again, let me say it two more times: Around half of the individuals that work at the NIH and CDC, the medical staff, refused to take the vaccines. That's right. The doctors, nurses and scientists do not trust a so-called vaccine. You shouldn't either. You should warn everyone you know about the truth. You're listening to the Alex Jones Show. You're listening to the SummitNews Radio Hour with Paul Joseph Watson. In the video that you just heard, I document how there's a new poll which shows that a full 10%, one in 10, of the British population don't want the lockdown to continue for just a few more months, for six months, for maybe another year. They want it to go on forever. They literally want to be told, mandated by the government, who they can see, how they can behave, where they can go, how they can move about the world for the rest of their natural lives. Imagine what kind of Stockholm syndrome, what kind of spineless jellyfish thinking it takes to actually believe that and admit to it. But it's no surprise, given what we've heard over the past few days, given this revelation that the scientific advisory group, the SPIB, which advised the UK government on lockdown back in March 2020, openly admitted using psychological techniques of manipulation- and quote- mind control to make the British public way more terrified than they needed to be based on the actual threat of the virus itself, because they wanted total compliance. This was the problem that they had within the halls of government here in the UK from these scientific dictatorship overlords who wanted to mimic how China had imposed their lockdown, despite admitting that it was draconian and totalitarian. people within the British government thought the British public are not nearly as compliant, as submissive, as groveling as East Asians and they will never go along with it. So the scientists came back and said: it's fine, we can just use extreme brutalist techniques of psychological manipulation and mind control. And you've seen the polls since it's worked to AT, with upwards of 70,, 75, 80% of the British public continually supporting lockdown throughout the entire one year period and one in 10 still saying that they want it to continue forevermore, indefinitely. the headline out of the London Telegraph- Use of theater control behavior and COVID crisis was totalitarian, admit scientists. members of scientific pandemic influenza group on behavior express regret about unethical methods, and not only do they admit what I outlined in the video there, they also told the journalists as part of this report that in March 2020, the government was very worried about compliance and they thought people wouldn't want to be locked down again. They're not going to go along with it as the submissive, compliant East Asians did, where they were literally being welded inside their homes by the authorities. There were discussions about fear being needed to encourage compliance and decisions were made about how to ramp up the fear. The way we abuse fear is dystopian. They say that now, a year too late. They go on to say, quote: the use of fear has definitely been ethically questionable. It's been like a weird experiment, a mass experiment in social engineering. Ultimately it backfired because people became too scared. So they admit that their methods of psychological manipulation, terrorizing the public, public, was so effective that people became too scared. And that's what led to the polls, which have also featured in the past, where back in last summer, the average Brit thought that coronavirus had killed 100 times more people than it actually had, which is why they were so eager, enthusiastic, to go along with these lockdown measures and then enforce them on everybody else. And they openly admit. there's another SPIV member said, quote: you could call psychology mind control. That's what we do. Clearly we try and go about it in a positive way, but it has been used nefariously in the past. Oh, it's positive psychological manipulation and mind control. It's positive terrorization of the British public. One warm that people use the pandemic to grab power and drive through things that wouldn't happen, Otherwise we have to be very careful about the authoritarianism that is creeping in. Well, it's already creeped in. It's a year too late, It goes on to say. another member of this SPIV- again this is the scientific body that advised the government to lock down- said they were stunned by the weaponization of behavioral psychology during the pandemic and that psychologists didn't seem to notice when it stopped being altruistic and became manipulative. They have too much power and it intoxicates them. And I go on to say it was literally totalitarianism what they did. And this report received very little attention. And yet still people are saying, oh, but there's a new variant. Surely the lockdown needs to be reversed, Surely, in many senses, it needs to go on forevermore, despite the very scientist who advised the government on this lockdown being proven spectacularly wrong in their own models And then admitting that it was- quote, totalitarian mind controlling. yet they're still listening to these same people- Absolutely incredible. Meanwhile, whistleblower Chelsea Manning compares lockdown to solitary confinement. says people will take years to recover. Manning was in solitary confinement for 11 months, So probably in a position to know what that feels like and the psychological impact that it has. now saying that people will take years to recover from this And that in many senses it is very similar to solitary confinement, not only in the imprisonment but then in the aftermath, getting used to reemerging into society afterwards, proving very hard for these people who've literally been traumatized and given PTSD because of the government hired mind control behavioral scientists to terrify them into thinking that death was waiting around every corner. So no surprise that they're now completely traumatized, PTSD ridden and finding it hard to reintegrate into normal society. Zero Hedge reports. two months after Biden blasted the endothel thinking, Texas reports zero COVID deaths. Texas Governor Greg Abbott elicited criticism from Dr Fauci and House Democrats when he decided to drop all COVID-19 link restrictions in the lone star state back in March- In fact it was March the 10th. two weeks after that they had the biggest decline in COVID cases ever recorded, the lowest COVID cases ever recorded. And now, two months later- as of I think it was Sunday or Monday- for the first time throughout the entire pandemic since records began, Texas reported zero COVID deaths. zero COVID deaths over two months after dropping these mask mandates. Do the mask mandates really stop infection of COVID-19? Or do they make it worse? We've featured the graphs many times out of France, Italy, Germany, Spain, where they all impose these mandatory mask mandates, not just indoors but outdoors, everywhere. And as soon as they impose them, the cases skyrocketed. because people are touching the masks, They don't even wear them properly, half the time they're putting it onto surfaces and things like that. They're not staying away from people in terms of distancing from people, because again, they think they're this wanted superhuman that they get to wear the mask. Not only does it protect them from the virus, but it enables them to harass, intimidate, bully, ostracize and socially shame anyone who doesn't wear a mask. And that's what Rachel Maddow was particularly concerned about in her rant a few days ago. headline Rachel Maddow says she will have to rewire her brain to not view maskless as a threat. And now we see a whole wave of these similar comments of leftists saying either they'll refuse to stop wearing the mask because they're so invested in the cult that they just can't let it go, Or even if they do take the mask off, they're lamenting the sad passing of the justification: the ability to harass, intimidate, shout at socially ostracize, publicly shame people in the street who never wore a mask at any point. They're very sad that their cult is coming to an end. Summit on News. we'll be right back, And they've harassed and almost shut down everybody else.

Well, Joe Rogan gave a statement on his podcast yesterday, basically saying that woke cancel, culture was out of control. And now for the past 24 hours once again he's been trending on Twitter with people saying how ridiculous Joe Rogan could even suggest that woke cancel culture is out of control And then proceeding to savagely attack him for 24 hours and try to cancel him because cancel culture doesn't exist. according to them, They literally have Spotify employees in their offices in New York mutiny and threatened to quit because he hosts an Alex Jones podcast. If people at cancel culture doesn't exist, he's still trending because he made these comments, with people viciously attacking him, trying to cancel him, while saying he's talking nonsense and that none of it exists. The Daily Mail did a poll and I tweeted this yesterday or a couple of days ago, under the headline why do they have cultural power when they're an extremist minority, And it asked the question: who backed these woke ideas? It goes through a list of different ideas, asking people in the United Kingdom, Out of a survey of over 2000 people, what percentage supported each statement. The use of historical figures being taken down: support 18%- oppose 59%. the clear majority. men being allowed to read and find themselves as women and access women only facilities: support 19%- oppose 48%. a clear majority. breastfeeding being renamed chestfeeding: support 5%- oppose 68%. children being allowed to use puberty blockers and hormone therapy to change their gender: support 13% oppose 61%, and it goes through a bunch of others, clearly indicating once again that this woke minority is an extremist fringe yet, for whatever reason, has all the cultural cache, all the power in society. There was another poll today and it asked Brits- I think this was Brits- are you woke? Yes, 12%. An extremist minority of 12% literally runs society. It's probably more than 12% in Sweden, where we have this headline today, Church of Sweden announces that it is trends, whatever that means. The Church of Sweden has published an open letter signed by a long list of priests, deacons and other church staff, proudly announcing that it is trends. The church is transgender. now, maybe God too is transgender. This was posted on their official website. It decried the fact that some feminists are trying to protect female spaces from biological men. They don't want hairy men with balls walking into their swimming changing rooms in front of their children. Oh my God, how horrible, how bigoted, how offensive, how intolerant- as well as they don't want massive biological men with clear strength, physique endurance, stamina advantages, completely obliterating female athletes in female sports. Again, how dare they? And for this the Church of Sweden, which is the largest Lutheran domination in the entirety of Europe, came out and published an official letter saying that this contributes to the normalization of trends- hate, As I point out in the article, despite the fact that the LGBT movement is now embraced and amplified by every major cultural institution, transnational corporation, celebrity and government entity in the West, apparently simply not wanting your daughter to be exposed to men in the changing room of swimming pools. that's hatred and that has to stop. We also had the Church of Sweden come out- in 2019,, by the way- and literally announced that Greta Thunberg, the global warming climate activist, was Jesus's successor. Yes, they actually said that. They actually came out with a state- This is the largest Lutheran domination church in the entirety of Europe- and they came out and proclaimed Greta Thunberg to be the second coming of Christ. On that subject, about these woke corporations, these woke technocratic bureaucracies wrap themselves in the rainbow flag, wrap themselves in this LGBT movement rhetoric as a disguise to high criticism of their own agenda. We had the World Health Organization yesterday come out and say literally- let me find the article here- that they're more concerned, not about economics, not about the great reset which they're trying to push through, not about poverty, but, in terms of their tweet yesterday, they're very concerned about one vitally important issue in particular to the global economy, to the globalist technocrat empire, And that is homosexual characters on television. We have the clip right now. Let's go to it. We'll come back and talk about it. Here's the clip. What's the World Economic Forum concerned about now? The great reset, Poverty Economics? No, they're concerned about gay characters on TV. Yeah, really, Where are the LGBTQI plus characters on TV? Only 9.1%. Wait a minute. In a typical Western country, 2 to 5% of the population identify as LGBT. In the UK, according to the Office for National Statistics, it's around 2%. In the US, a recent Gallup survey found that 5.6% of Americans now identify as LGBTQ, up from 4.5% in 2017.. And that whole 1.0% rise in the space of three years alone had absolutely nothing to do with social engineering whatsoever. But even if you take the highest number, as with every other minority group, people who identify as LGBT are significantly overrepresented on television- By almost double if you take the higher number and by three times as much if you take the lower number. LGBTQI plus people made up just 9.1% of the regular characters on scripted TV shows in the US, according to a report by media advocacy group GLAAD. So just 200% higher than their actual number in real life. then How many LGBT characters do you want? 25%, 50%, 100%? How about we look at whether or not, in 2021, straight white men are fairly represented on television in line with their population demographic percentage? No, no one's interested in that. Every year we have another Oscars. so white controversy, Despite the fact that even before the cult of Woke took over, statistics showed that black people were fairly represented according to their population percentage. Why is a globalist financial body like the World Economic Forum talking about gay characters on TV? Because, just like every other globalist transnational entity, they've used the cult of intersectionality to tie their agenda to centralized power, with Woke campaigns that advocate for minority groups. Because, whereas it's easy to criticize a group of privileged billionaires like the WEF, it's becoming increasingly impossible to criticize the LGBT movement without facing severe social repercussions, official persecution or even arrest. The LGBT movement is more protected by the establishment and wields more power than even technocratic behemoths like the WEF. LGBT rhetoric is now embraced and amplified by every major cultural institution, transnational corporation and government entity in the West. You know, because they're so oppressed and all that, Which is why groups like the WEF hitch their car to that horse. You're being critical of the World Economic Forum. What are you, a homophobe? now Suspicious about the great reset? Why do you hate gay people? Klaus Schwab says: give up that pesky private property, take the brain shit and just let billionaire technocrats take control of everything. No, But he's wrapped in a rainbow flag. Oh, okay, go on then. So this entire LGBT movement went from: oh, we just want to get gay married, we just want tolerance. So that, and now to this. this is a headline out of Breitbart Crafter offers bitty book soft packer: crochet penis pattern for young, trans and non-binary children. So the transgender Crafter is advertising a pattern for a crocheted prosthetic penis that can be borne by young, trans and non-binary children. And on this advertisement they literally show it attached to a diaper: A knitted penis for extremely small girls to wear in their pants if their parents believe them to be transgender. Can you imagine the level of mental illness and predator-like behavior for somebody to literally want to attach a knitted prosthetic penis to the young girl who still wears a diaper? It went from gay marriage intolerance to this. It's gone too far. literally drag queen kids being paraded around in nightclubs at midnight taking tips from weirdos and perverts, Now prosthetic knitted penises- absolutely revolting. We'll be right back, don't go away. In-game blueprint for global enslavement, made 14 years ago, accurately predicted the globalist takeover using the great reset and the threat of a virus.

You're listening to SummitNews with Paul Joseph Watson. Well, we've had big news out of France over the past few weeks or so. Initially, we had a letter penned by retired military generals warning of a civil war in France thanks to the unintegrated migrants, thanks to the anti-racism movement that wants to topple statues, that wants to dilute the national identity of friends, that wants to literally tear apart the country. Then we had another letter by active duty military service members, again in France, saying that they agreed with the retired military generals. They thought civil war was definite possibility and that they would defend the country at all costs. Now we have another poll out of France. By the way, there was an initial poll after that first letter written by the retired generals. that showed that the majority- 58%- of the French population said that they supported the letter and that they also feared that civil war in France was imminent. Now we have another poll. this is out of Breitbart says: 71% of French say the country has had enough of immigration. A survey measuring the fraternity between residents of France has revealed that 71% of French think there has been enough immigration and have no desire to see any more. Don't forget, we also had the article last week where Michel Barnier, the EU's advisor on Brexit, the guy who brokered the Brexit deal with the United Kingdom- by no means a right wing populist, nationalist, a centrist or even a globalist to some extent Even he's now come out and said that they want a three to five year total ban on immigration into all EU countries. Remember when Donald Trump said that back in 2015,, 2016,. a simple ban on a select number of Muslim countries labelled dangerous, labelled from where terrorists were coming, ISIS militants. of course, the top five countries, the top five Muslim populated countries, weren't even on that list, But he was pilloried, he was torn apart by the media as a dangerous racist for advocating for that- quote- Muslim ban on immigration, even though it wasn't a Muslim ban, given that the top five Muslim populated countries were not banned. Now Michel Barnier, a globalist, is talking about a total three to five year ban, a blanket ban across the entire continent. He's probably going to run in next year's French presidential election along with Marine Le Pen and, of course, President Macron himself. But now a survey again in France showing that 71% think there's been too much immigration. they don't desire to see any more. So we have the two letters from retired and current duty military personnel warning of civil war because of these vast unintegrated areas on the edge of French cities where there's complete lawlessness. Whenever the police try to go in to enforce the law, if there's been a violent attack, if they're looking for a criminal suspect, they get pelted with rocks. they get pelted with fireworks by the local migrant population and they hightail it out of there. Buildings, cars set on fire, violent riots on a regular basis. the ambulance workers, the firemen, go in, they try to do their job. they also get chased out of the area. Don't forget that after the Paris massacre, one of the lead terrorists, the lead jihadist in that massacre, Salah Abdeslam. he was able to hide away in one of these no-go zone Islamist ghettos that the media says doesn't exist across the border in Brussels, Belgium, for a total of four months, The most wanted man in Europe was able to hide away in the capital of a major European city after being complicit in a massacre that killed hundreds of people, for four months being protected by the local population. This is the situation we have in many European capitals in 2021, which is why the military and now the police are warning that France is on the brink of collapse. and we're going to go to that video right now: X cops warn France is, as a result of all these problems, with lack of integrated migrants, with the anti-racism movement tearing apart the social fabric of France, the country faces potential civil war. Here's the video: Open attacks on police stations by hordes of armed and hooded individuals are spreading across our nation with impunity states the letter, adding that France has quote- fragmented into enclaves. Violence against individuals spreads even into the privacy of family residences, and the only response to these crimes against law enforcement consists of compassionate incantations, which have no effect on the daily life of the French people. In France, cops are routinely attacked by gangs and roaming migrant mobs whenever they try to enforce the law in unruly areas. Figures for the last year show that nearly 9,000 French police officers were injured and 11 were killed in 2020.. After firefighters entered a sensitive urban zone in Brest on Thursday night, they were attacked by a mob of 40 youths, but police who arrived on the scene to protect them were ordered not to make arrests due to Ramadan and the Israel-Palestine conflict. That's lawlessness. That's a minority population being given carte blanche to commit crimes. And whenever a criminal suspect is killed in a confrontation with authorities, migrant populations routinely respond by rioting for days or weeks on end. The emergency also requires controlling illegal immigration states. the letter, which plagues many neighborhoods and contributes to fueling disorder and delinquency. The letter demands that police be equipped materially, morally and legally to enable them to carry out their duties without having to risk their lives. on every street corner, The former officers assert that it's time, to quote: reclaim our country and demand that France has shared values are respected. They're calling for a surge which mirrors the rhetoric espoused by French intellectual Eric Zemore, who called for the military to reconquer such areas. France must not fall into chaos. the letter concludes. We hope that our call for a national surge will be heard by public authorities and we join our voices to those of our military comrades who spoke first. Fears over the collapse of law and order in France are shared by the majority of the French public. The poll last month found that a whopping 86% agreed that some cities had areas where French law does not apply, while 73% said that French society was disintegrating. The warning from police follows two separate letters that were signed off on by retired military generals and active duty French military. They warned that the country was headed towards civil war thanks to the twin threat of the anti-racism movement, which seeks to disintegrate France's national identity via colonialism, guilt trips and statue toppling, Aligned with the Islamist takeover of areas surrounding major cities. thanks to the abject failure of integration and multiculturalism. The original letter warned about the threat posed by entities that, quote- despise our country, its traditions, its culture and want to see it dissolve by tearing away at its past and its history. The French political establishment has obviously reacted to all three letters by scoffing and dismissing them as the work of right-wing extremists. But 60% of military and police would support populist Marine Le Pen in a hypothetical presidential runoff against Macron. I guess 60% of France's security apparatus must all be right-wing extremists. A 2019 peer-reviewed study by Danish academics found that, despite its constant invocation, diversity actually isn't a strength. Seeking to answer whether continued immigration and corresponding growing ethnic diversity was having a positive impact on community cohesion, the study found the opposite to be the case, And there's no more perfect illustration of that than modern-day France, One of the whitest areas of California- and I checked on the demographic count. BLM co-founder Patrice Kahn-Khlauss is now complaining about white supremacy in the housing market. So she bought four homes at a cost of $3.2 million total, including a $1.4 million property in LA's rustic and semi-remote- very remote- if you're a black person, because there's basically none of them there- to pangor canyon. She also bought a custom ranch in Georgia which is surrounded by 3.2 rural acres and features a private airplane hangar with a studio apartment above it, in addition to an indoor swimming pool. So she's had no trouble in spending part of the $90 million that Black Lives Matter has ranked in in donations over the last year alone. But apparently she's really concerned about white supremacy in the housing market. She shared a headline out of NPR which said: Black Americans and the racist architecture of home ownership. Basically, black people aren't being able to afford to buy enough homes, But the same reason that everybody else isn't: because the cost of those homes far outstrips wages. of course, with inflation added, that's also the main reason. She's not affected by that. She's whining about people not being able to buy homes in Compton, while she literally spends millions of dollars on homes in the whitest areas available, where no black people live. It's going to wrap it up. War Room is coming up. next SummitNews. I'll go away.InfoWars, the most banned network in the world. US Code Title 42, Part G in section 265.. With the approval of the president, the surgeon general has the power to prohibit foreign immigration in order to avert the dangerous spread of communicable disease. This was enacted in 1944 and used in March of 2020, when the Trump administration issued a public health order calling for the rapid expulsion, and US immigration facilities are already at 150% capacity. So the tens of thousands of illegal immigrants waiting at the Southern border will just have to be taken care of at the expense of the US taxpayer during the biggest financial crisis in US history. If this doesn't make sense to you, then you need to realize that America is under attack. Last weekend, two separate terrorist attacks were carried out in Texas by members of the same prison gang syndicate, And if the US government cared about keeping the peace and the rule of law, then this sort of activity would obviously catalyze stricter border policies. But our government isn't doing that. They're opening the borders while US judges let loose violent criminals, because America is under attack. Michael Yaun has been reporting from the Darien province in Panama at a place known as the Darien Gap, where US funded invasion camp La Jasblancas has been processing hordes of military age. members of the communist Chinese party. Michael, can you speak more on why you suppose these are spies as opposed to simply economic migrants? So how are all these people getting these passports and how are they showing up with lots of cash? They have a lot of money, these Chinese coming through. They take a special route through Darien Gap, They take boat routes and then they'll walk about two days through the jungle through a much safer route. It's still a little bit difficult but it's nothing like the epic, real Darien Gap route through the mountain of death and all. There's actually Montaigne de la Muerte to the mountain of death. They don't go through any of that stuff And none of the Chinese women coming through ever report being raped. All sorts of women are raped, young and old and children and everything else, But not the Chinese. If this doesn't make sense to you, then you need to realize that America is under attack. In the book Unrestricted Warfare, senior military advisers of the communist Chinese wrote that the only way for China to defeat the US is by deploying several levels of unconventional warfare. Direct military confrontation would not succeed. You can call it communism, You can call it globalism. Whatever it is now has complete control over the US federal government and is waging war against every single American life As we know. it is quickly coming to an end And, whether you like it or not, the option to do nothing will soon be over. Reporting for InfoWars. this is Greg Reese. Well, the quickening is here. ladies and gentlemen, It's May 10th 2023. on this live Wednesday broadcast, This is going to be an incredible transmission: Owen Schroer working with Michael Yan on the border now in El Paso, And so much more today, And we have a psyop expert coming on to talk about the deep state's manipulation of our minds. Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution, is laying right there in front of you, hidden in plain view. Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds. If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN zone website where they admit the number one cause of cognitive disability in the world is iodine deficiency. The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability is lack of real, pure iodine in the body as they bomb us with the bad halogens, bromine, bromide, chlorine and so much more. Upwards of 2 billion people, in a Lancet medical journal study in 2007, worldwide have cognitive disabilities because they don't have high quality iodine. Most iodine is bound to other elements, You're going to absorb it. We have X3, all three types of the good iodine together that supercharges your body. X3 is now back in stock at InfoWarsTorecom. It's been sold out for over six months for 25% off. X3 back in stock. Take action now, InfoWarsTorecom. This is not a drill. This is the collapse of the Republic. The border has been completely removed. Millions are being held at federal centers now that have been overwhelmed. The border is collapsing now. Millions are coming. The Southern border has been completely collapsed by design as a direct attack on the United States of America. Our city is being overrun. 92% of the people out here are military age males. It's Wednesday, May 10th 2023.. I'm your embattled host, Alex Jones, Very blessed and honored to be here, Very thankful, humbly, for your support and your prayers. Please pray for our crew: Owen Schroer and others, Rob Dew and others And our security team is in El Paso. They're linking up with Michael Yaun, reporter, former special forces operator and great patriot. This is going to be massive coverage today, tomorrow, Friday, into Saturday and over the weekend, And I'm planning to get down there very, very soon as well. I'll just leave it at that. Uh, there is a lot going on, obviously. Let me give you a little prelude of what we're going to be hitting. BBC reports first: humanoid baby born made out of three people. Journal of science confirms chemicals in the water supply are sterilizing not just amphibians but the fish. Mainstream news: All hell breaks loose at nuclear armed Pakistan after former president's arrest. That spills over into Europe. European study confirms the presence of nuclear weapons in Pakistan. Carbon jabs causing learned term brain damage. We have the Sybil ruling by a kangaroo court in New York with absolutely no evidence that Trump defamed a woman by saying he didn't sexually assault her. Next level twisting. The woman then did a victory tour on CNN and sounded like a complete and total maniac, saying rape is hot And telling Anderson Cooper he's hot. Trump's never met her. There is just. there is just so much insanity going on, Ladies and gentlemen. Trump to appeal jury finds liable for sexual abuse. We'll break that down. Congressman George Santos charged with fraud, money laundering, theft of public funds and false statements. What he did was one: 1 million to what the Clintons have done. He admits to lying- They all lie constantly, but of course they're not getting arrested. And that ties into this news. We'll be playing the video house oversight committee. at a press conference this morning, The Biden family, their associates and their companies received over 10 million from foreign nationals and their companies, mainly the communist Chinese and the Ukrainians. But of course the justice department will do nothing because we have a coup. We have more on the collapse border with New York suburbs: Panic for New York city. Mayor announces migrant relocation program to ship the upwards of a million illegal aliens into the suburbs and have taxpayer money pay to house them indefinitely in hotels- The exact European collapse model. Chelsea Clinton pledges to forcibly inject American children. The view says subway passengers should just have given their money to serial criminal Neely. Her Carlson announces Twitter show. Elon Musk tweets: cool, Welcome. I've got the inside baseball on that and why it's so important. A lot of critical AI news. We're going to be breaking down Texas AG to investigate hospitals that provide irreversible gender transition care to minors And we have grizzly video and photos of how they give girls a penis. They chop most of the meat off their forearm, create an artificial penis that normally rots and falls off. Uh, it's beyond Hellraiser. It's what they're doing. We will continue on from there, looking at new evidence of how electric cars have a bigger carbon footprint, Then gas cars will break that down. I try to take some more fossil fuel to create one than a car driven on average a hundred thousand miles. We'll ever use of petrol, of gasoline as we call it here in America. video RFK repeats assertion that CIA killed JFK on Fox news. ex-Russian space boss finds no proof. Americans land on the moon. It goes on and on. but obviously even bigger news in the collapsed border by design and the UN replacement migration operation is the humanoid baby born in the UK. Now, this is obviously not the first, but they're saying it's the first because now they're rolling it all out, Maybe born from three people. That's a humanoid first born in the UK. We've got a lot of reparations news as well, Well, and what the real plan behind all of that is here today. But the first thing I want to get into is we're going to have a lot of border coverage later in the broadcast and over the next few days. title 42 expires tonight at midnight, but they're not waiting for that. It's effectively gone. The border patrols reporting 150,000 people are currently on the Texas border about to come across in the next 48 hours. But let's go ahead and get to the death of justice in this country and what that really signifies. We have a statute of limitations for a reason, And for rape, depending on jurisdiction, it's five to 10 years. We know according to federal studies- and I agree with the numbers, I've seen it myself- that upwards of half or more of reports of sexual assault are false. This woman has no proof. This woman has no witnesses. This woman has nothing. None of the so-called evidence she was going to bring was ever brought in, because it wasn't true in my view. And Trump has been found liable $5 million, not for raping her but reportedly lying about her when he said he was innocent. It is your constitutional right in civil and in criminal proceedings to declare innocence. Everybody knows that, Don't need to be a lawyer to know it. And so he was found guilty of saying I don't know this woman. This isn't true. Now I happen to know Trump's MO because I'm good friends with his wingman for 44 years and off record I mean Roger's not going to get in trouble for this, but I've really picked his brain about Richard Nixon, who he was confidants with, and Donald Trump And Roger Stone has been both men's after Trump met him 40 plus years ago And, of course, after Nixon got out of office he got to be a lot better friends with Roger and Roger knew both men's women. He was beyond a wingman, I'll leave it at that. Donald Trump lavished his women with praise, is nothing but nice to them when he wants a woman and it's nothing but a pure gentleman. but if a woman is mean to him or is rude to him, one time he drops them like an old shoe. Trump would never be peed on. That's why I sort of you know really picking Roger's brain off record about Trump years ago I said: is any of this true? And he said absolutely not. Trump had to actually do anti-aversion therapy. That's a little secret. He actually trained himself more than 30 years ago and was consulted with psychologists and experts to be able to shake people's hands. Trump is a germaphobe and courts women for a while and really gets to know them and things and then he's with that woman. but there's an issue: he goes with another woman. So he's not even promiscuous in the classic sense that he's like you know, like these Hollywood people- three, four women a week. it's not like that He. he pursues a woman, He goes after him. He's with them usually a year, two, three years and then there's a problem and it's over And so. so I've done the background research on this and he likes big bombshell, powerful women, the opposite of what pedophiles want. I mean, look at his wife. I mean that lady's like I've seen her, I've met her, intimidating in person, Uh, that's the kind of woman Trump wants is a flame throwing, You know, thousand horsepower woman. pedophiles want control and power over little kids and there's no evidence Trump was ever, you know, around any kids with Epstein, and they've definitely researched that. So it's not his MO to rape a woman, but regardless, we have a statute of limitations and we have weaponized courts and this is a travesty. So we're going to cover this when we come back because it's so incredibly important. but no, Trump was not in a Moscow hotel being pissed on And Trump did not rape this woman, and no one's buying it. but the system doesn't care. They're just going forward as if all these weaponized courts are convincing us. No, it's convincing us that our country is totally hijacked by criminals. Now they admit the pee garbage never happened. Please give me one minute of your time, Please write this down and please go look this up. It will change your life. The UN admits, and the Lanzik medical journal admits, that upwards of 2 billion people have mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities. The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine. Most iodine in the environment is bound to other elements, so your body can't absorb it. Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells, And Infowarsstorecom has the only iodine out there that actually has this type of full effect.

Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, is a historic book that documents the globalist, in their own words, plan for our future. That is a hellish future. Now you'll be always- while they still allow books- I guess they're starting to ban them- be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores, Amazon or infowarestorecom, but you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out and there's about a thousand left of them right now. So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World, a signed copy, at infowarestorecom- And there is a markup there, because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air. So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, You'll also know that you help keep InfoWars on the air. I'm going to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned copies, but I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to infowarestorecom and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate to the library or get them to the local school. This is an InfoWar. I'm counting on you and thank you for your support, Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones, All right. so there are dozens of investigations going against President Trump- federal and state. He's been indicted in New York, as you know. and then this woman, E Jean Carroll, comes out a few years ago for the first time ever and says Trump, almost 30 years ago, 29 years ago, raped her in a department store changing room that she reportedly followed him into. I mean, none of this makes any sense. And then you listen to the woman and you watch the woman and she comes off, in my view, like a complete lunatic. She's a cross between Gozer the Destroyer from Ghostbusters and the Prophet from Poltergeist. So let's play a clip of her talking about. most people think of rape as sexy. no, most people don't. The word rape carries so many sexual connotations. This was not sexual. She goes on to then start hitting on Anderson Cooper. He ends the segment early because she's embarrassing herself so much. Here's the clip. I feel like a victim. I was not thrown on the ground and ravished which the word rape carries so many sexual connotations. This was not. this was not sexual. It just it hurt. It just it. just. you know. I think most people think of rape as a I mean it is a violent assault. It is not. I think most people think of rape as being sexy. Let's take a short break. We've got to take a quick break. If you can stick around, we'll talk more on the other side. You're fascinating to talk to. What a kook, what a weirdo. And then Trump isn't allowed to say he didn't rape her. Everybody knows you're allowed. you'd be caught robbing a bank with bags of money in your hands. You can tell the jury you're innocent. But what did they say in my Connecticut show trial last year? The judge said: you're not allowed to say you're innocent, not allowed to say you don't have hundreds of millions of dollars. All that proven a lie. now They put on their fake evidence. They tell the jury I'm guilty. This is what happens. Trump's type is not the prophet from poltergeist. Come to the light, little girl. Absolutely frightening. Trump's put out a statement. It's a disgrace. I don't even know this woman. Update. President Trump promises to appeal New York sexual abuse jury verdict. So he wasn't found criminally guilty. It wasn't a criminal trial And they didn't find that there was evidence of rape. They said it was a lie, that he didn't assault her with no evidence. Think of the mental gymnastics of that. Meanwhile, the border is wide open, Hundreds of thousands of children a year being smuggled in, many into sex slavery, Many into sweatshops. as young as seven. That's all confirmed in the Washington Post reports. But that's okay. This lady says Donald Trump grabbed her crotch 29 years ago and they built it all around him, saying: women don't like doing that. when you're famous, why don't you just grab them by the? He was just saying that as an example, But off of that comment he's now guilty. Billionaire who funded E Jean Carroll's lawsuit against Trump visited Epstein's Island many, many times. Isn't that interesting? A Democrat billionaire who funded E Jean Carroll's lawsuit against Trump visited every Epstein's private island and met him on at least two other occasions. record show Trump was ordered to pay New York City jury to pay 5 million in damages to E Jean Carroll for sexually abusing her nearly three decades ago in a department store changing room. The former president was found responsible for defaming Carroll by calling her a liar after asserting that he had never even met the woman. Not allowed to have your statement, You're innocent. Trump called the case a con job, posing a true social that he was absolutely no idea the woman is, and the verdict a continuation of the greatest witch hunt of all time. The civil verdict, which was overseen by Clinton-appointed judge Louis Kaplan, is likely to remain tied up in appeal for a significant amount of time, during which Trump won't have to pay Carroll anything, But they'll call him a rapist when he does. the CNN town hall Democrat, megadonor Reid Hoffman, is currently funding a lawsuit filed by E Jean Carroll accusing Trump of rape, even though she once said rape is sexy. and it just goes on from there. Meanwhile, Bill Clinton is a known serial rapist who settled claims of it, but that's okay because he's a Democrat. E Jean Carroll says verdict in Trump case is a victory for all victims of sexual assault, Not the kids being smuggled across the border, and it goes on and on. Trump world books CNN hoping for a big audience. Now they're in for the thick of it, where he'll be massively attacked, Politico reports. New York Post says this verdict will hurt Trump more than some backers think Really. No, nobody buys this bull. They know it's all rigged courts where they file these suits. Sexual abuse verdict reduced Republican doubts about Trump's electability. No, it only made people support Trump more because they know this is a load of crap. He's not Jeffrey Epstein, He's not Harvey Weinstein, He's not Bill Clinton, And this is deranged behavior. And it's the same thing with Congressman George Santos. I don't like him. The guy is a hilarious liar and a lot of the lies he tells the guy's a complete fraud And he came out and said: well, most people in Congress lie. I'm just being like them. I admit I'm a fraud. That's refreshing. Oh, but now they're saying campaign finance, since he lied about stuff in his campaign. That's a finance like they're getting criminal charges ready. The special prosecutor is on Trump for quote lying and saying there was election fraud and raising money off of it. Well, Trump's allowed to have his opinion, plus there's massive evidence of it, But now he's got to be indicted for campaign finance fraud. That's what they've done in New York with Alvin Bragg Because he reportedly gave a woman some money. People see right through this Congressman George Santos charged with fraud, money laundering, theft of public funds and false statements. So that's the low-hanging fruit, because he's a Republican that won in the district. They're not going to let that happen, but the Democrats can lie all they want all day long. Now let's shift to this clip. The House Oversight Committee, the Biden family, their associates and their companies received over $10 million from foreign nationals and their companies. The committee found in their investigations, but they don't have prosecutorial power and so the Justice Department will do nothing. Joe Biden could literally vivisect and eat a child's brain, live on TV And they would say the child was lucky. Here is the clip: Joe Biden's son, Joe Biden's brother, Joe Biden's brother's wife, Hunter Biden's girlfriend or Beau Biden's widow, however. you want to write that None of them. Hunter Biden's ex-wife, Hunter Biden's current wife And three children of the president's son and the president's brother. So we're talking about a grandchild. That's odd. People that work hard. every day's grandchild doesn't get a wire from a foreign national or anything like that. So that'll conclude our question. We got more of the press conference coming up- Over $10 million, mainly from shy comps. We have Hunter Biden's recordings. I work for the head of Chinese intelligence and he's been gone for a month and no one knows where he is. I don't have anybody to give me orders, daddy. What do I do? I'm a Chinese spy, But don't worry. We got Donald Trump indicted and they're trying to indict everybody else. This country has had a coup over, And now the very globalists that have had a coup with the country are destroying it and starting World War Three and dissolving the border right in front of our eyes, and lying to black people and saying they're going to get $800 billion in reparations. That's what California is promising. We're going to explain a lot of that coming up as well. Big broadcast. Stay with us. Oh, and, of course, humanoids, now born in the UK. Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, The solution, is laying right there in front of you, hidden in plain view. Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.

Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones. Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones. It is not an overstatement- in fact, words cannot properly describe it- to lay out what's happening to this country and the rest of the Western world. We are witnessing a controlled dismantlement, a controlled demolition, the end of civilization as we know it, A social contract from the globalists declaring war on our livelihoods, our very lives, our freedoms and our children. Our reporters are on the ground now and we'll have them on later in the broadcast and right through the war room. today, at 3 pm Central, We are linking up with investigative journalist Michael Yan in El Paso. We have a special guest joining us in the second hour that I'm really excited about having on Ex-US Army PSYOP expert. Fox News fired Carlson to maintain semi-lobotomized, quasi-retarded population. We'll have a bunch of Tucker Carlson news on why that's so important, with Scott Bennett coming up next hour. The third hour I'm going to focus on transhumanism and how the whole trans movement is just the leading edge of the murder of logic. Humanoid babies are being born all over the world. They've been doing it for at least 25 years. that we know of in the medical journals but now it's hitting mainstream news. BBC reports first humanoid born in UK And that ties in to all this other news we have on the revolution we're facing. But I'll explain this one more time. 99.9999999% of you will be hurt by this and will be destroyed by this. You can pretend you're part of the system. You can play along with it all you want. You can try to profit from it. You are dumping gasoline on yourself and lighting yourself on fire in slow motion. You'd do better to go jump off a cliff than serve this system. This is insane. These people running the planet are completely insane. They are total evil And that is the best description of them: Total evil. Alright, the videos are all on Infowarscom, See Watson article video. 150,000 illegal immigrants are camping out waiting to surge the border tomorrow. That's Border Patrol estimates. We have the Fox News report, The warning The Guatemalan president reportedly tried to give the White House, but they ignored it. From town hall. From town hall, They said at least 80,000 have crossed in just the last week out of Guatemala, From Venezuela, running from the communist dreamland, And are headed towards the US border ahead of 42's expiration tomorrow. Now what is this crisis that's been created? Well, if you watched the congressional hearings back in 1986 and 7 on Iran-Contra, an interesting secret document came out by FEMA and the Pentagon titled Rex 84. It's declassified, Parts of it are declassified. This is not my opinion- And the plan was to use the collapsed border to bring in a civil emergency and a suspension of Congress's powers under executive orders. Those executive orders have been continued on. You can go to the Wikipedia, You can follow links to YouTube, You can watch the hearings. We played hours of these over the years. I put clips of it in my police state films And Reagan did not implement the operation. but it has now been implemented. It was meant to break down civil society. New York suburbs panic after New York City Mayor plans migrant relocation. Rich New York suburbanites are in a huff over a plan by New York City, Eric Adams, to relocate migrants that they told to come here to hotels in their towns. The NIMBY New Yorkers reacted with shock and dismay at Adams' Friday statement that he plans to pay to house 300 migrant men. It's millions folks. It's always a small amount. first, In two hotels in Rockland, Orange County, the illegal immigrants were bussed there from Texas and other places. Millions are coming across. When 40-something got shipped to Martha's Vineyard, they kicked them out in less than 24 hours- Not in my backyard, So we're going to be looking at more of that coming up here today. But this is the absolute planned destruction of the country. Now we still have a lot of time in this segment, but I want to get to this next segment and tie this all together with so-called reparations And what that's really being done. to do to bring in the social credit score, to bring in the universal basic income with all those controls, and to basically form people into racial gangs controlled by the Democratic Party, to persecute and terrorize white people, into a larger endgame of societal race war. They're hitting us from all sides, but everybody, no matter what color you are, is in the crosshairs of this attack. That's coming up And it ties into all the Walmarts and T-Mobiles and grocery stores and Whole Foods and just Walgreens closing all their stores in major cities like Chicago and San Francisco. And then you watch the governments double down on those policies. That's because whether you're in Australia or whether you're in the US, whether you're in Germany or Canada, it's the same policies, the same blueprints, the same operation. It is to own nothing and have nothing and like it. In fact, we have a Klaus Schwab clip in French, but it's subtitled- where he goes further. He says: you'll have no rights, no freedom, You're going to serve everything you do and you're going to have nothing. But it's loving. But under their new world order regime we've gone from a few hundred people having half the wealth to a few hundred people having 80% of the wealth. So when they talk about this, it's not for them, It's for you. They want a permanent poor underclass that they can do anything to.

The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability is lack of real, pure iodine in the body. as they bomb us with the bad halogens, bromine, bromide chlorine and so much more. Upwards of 2 billion people in a Lancet Medical Journal study in 2007, worldwide have cognitive disabilities because they don't have high quality iodine.

I'm addicted to spreading the truth and again, you know, I have Infowars to thank for that. Looking back on the day I was able to ask President Donald Trump two questions. I was so grateful because, you know, I truly was classically trained under Alex Jones and under the Infowars team and I really do credit that as to why I'm able to, you know, get these types of clips, because Alex's whole mentality was, you know, go where the story is, go where the mainstream media refuses to. so it's not that I'm addicted to the insanity, I'm just addicted to telling the truth and helping the American people and I really do credit Alex for, you know, really instilling that within me early on in my career.

Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element, which has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population, and there are two things we need to do about it. We need to practice more regenerative farming. There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally keep the soil rich with iodine, and we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day. Derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the earth's surface, our Infowars Life Survival Shield X3 is, hands down the best Pure, nascent iodine, stabilized in an activated triiodine form, For a healthy thyroid and a healthy metabolism. get yours now at InfowarStorecom. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. it's Alex Jones. I got down on my knees. God is the answer. By the way, I was just reading Scott Bennett's bio that's joining us next hour. This guy's incredible. I mean I already knew who he was for years, but I was just rereading this. US Army Special Operations Officer, 11th Psychological Operations Battalion. He's the guy that exposed the Clintons and Obama giving weapons to Al Qaeda and they put him in prison for it. He's about to expose the New World Order big time and what they're doing. Next hour. ex-US Army PSYOPS expert. Fox News fired Carlson to maintain semi-lobotomized plaza retarded population. That's coming up All right. so I'm going to just ask everybody: I don't care what color you are, you all got red blood. God made you. God loves you. I'll ask everybody a question: Did Biden give everybody the free tuition and the loan forgiveness like he promised in his campaign? No, he's so nasty. he signed an executive order and then withdrew it. Some people hear he gave them something free, but he didn't. They can't give you something free. California just defaulted on their debt. It's a failed state of $18 billion. The state board and the local boards have promised $800 plus billion to Californian black people. Now you could print that much money up, I guess, and then suddenly a hamburger would cost $50,000.. I mean, does anyone believe this crap? But oh, once you get a universal basic income, you'll get $1,000 a month but you'll get discounts because you're black. but you're in a database, you're being controlled, and now we're in the system. Do you think welfare was good for black people? I mean, LBJ created it and said: we're going to control these people. They're not helping anybody. When you're hunting deer and you put out corn feeders for a month before deer season, are you giving the deer feed because you like them? No, you want them right where you want them. so when you want to take them out, you can. You want them on a real short lease. Pigs on a farm getting fattened up before they're slaughtered: are they giving the pigs food because they like them? Come on, people. This is beyond communism though. It's race war, it's culture war, it's Cloward and Pippen to bankrupt the country, and all the quote craziness you hear about in universities 20 years ago is now reality because it's a plan to take us down, just like sterilizing children and cutting their genitals off, or cutting little girls' forearms off, and pull those photos up of somebody this morning to give them an artificial penis that doesn't even work. These are the horrors of government and the horrors that they're just normalizing, all by design. right now, As the first humanoid is born in the UK BBC, So now T-Mobile shutters flagship San Francisco and mass exodus escalates. Walmart, Whole Foods- all closing All over the country in big cities. And here's another one: They've announced that by 2030, 90% of farms will be shut down because- quote, farms are bad for the earth because plants and animals create carbon dioxide. See, we produce it too. How does that make us wealthier? to cut off the third largest food producer in the world? You could have all the money all day long. Maybe you can wipe your ass with it, but it's digital. I guess you can't even do that. Where's the wealth? They're killing the energy. They're killing the culture. They're killing the education. They're killing the food production. but promising you $800 million? Sure, And I got a bridge. I'm ready to sell you an oceanfront property in Arizona And from my front porch you can see the sea And if you'll buy that, I'll throw the Golden Gate in free. I mean, come on, people. And it goes on from there. City Council urges white business owners be forced to pay black and brown-owned businesses. That's now what the government in California is pushing: Total discrimination. Well, they've got to get us ready for the social credit score. Here's Professor Thomas Scholl explaining it, And no one's legitimizing slavery. but there are six African countries that still have slavery. There's slavery in areas of the Middle East America's less barbarous than other countries, But there's this idea that, oh, we're evil, so we're going to lift the black people up. And you see the black people, some of them the one, being conned, and white people going to city council meetings, going to state meetings saying I want $200 million. It's ridiculous, ladies and gentlemen. Here's Thomas Scholl. Slavery has been a universal institution for thousands of years, as far back as you can trace human history, And what we're looking at is if slavery is something that happened to one race of people in one country when, in fact, the spread of it was around the world In 1776, which is when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations, as well as when the United States got started. he said that Western Europe is the only place in the world where there is no slavery. And even the Western Europeans had vast numbers of slaves in the Western Hemisphere, but not in Western Europe itself. And so if you're going to have reparations for slavery, it's going to be the greatest transfer of wealth back and forth and cross-hauling, as they say in the railroads, because the number of whites, for example, who were enslaved in North Africa by the Barbary pirates exceeded the number of Africans enslaved in the United States and in the American colonies before that put together. But nobody is going to North Africa to ask for reparations because nobody is going to be fool enough to give it to them. Here we have intellectuals who can imagine a different history from the rest of the world, even though it's so similar to the rest of the world. Let's lay out some more numbers. Anybody can look these up. I went off memory. I told the crew: pull up. when Germany abolished serfdom and when Russia did the 1860s and 1870s, White people lived on the land, were sharecroppers, had to stay on the land, were slaves, But they were so brainwashed they liked it. most of them, The Hessian soldiers, the German soldiers that wore the Hessian tall black boots that we fought in the Revolutionary War. they were born and bred to be war soldiers. They gave them fancy uniforms so they liked it. A lot of them actually got here and actually defected to the American side. So it gets worse. Look up the demographics. After 1865, 1866, slavery ending is when the majority of migrants from Europe came here. More migrants, more immigrants came here after the Civil War. so the majority of white people that all of us are related to were never involved in touching a black person or black slavery. In the South, 2% of the population owned slaves. It was the big fancy corporate farms with the big antebellum mansions. Most people were dirt farmers, white people. It was an elite that had the slaves. There are not many people around folks that ever have even ancestors that owned slaves, especially if you live in the Northeast or the West Coast and places like that. Yes, a lot of people from the South did have some ancestor back there that had slaves, but those are realities. How the hell if my father hypothetically committed a murder or my grandfather did, and then their grandkids come to me and say you've got to pay money? your daddy shot and killed my grandma and he served 20 years in jail for it and you owe me money. I'd laugh at you. But this is even more crazy. So that's the plan. California panel approves reparations of $1.2 million each for black residents. $200 million is demanded. California defaults on $18.6 billion in debt. San Francisco backs reparations plans, including $5 million to eligible black adults. California reparations task force approves proposal $569 billion. Now they've come out and said they want $800 billion. This is sick, ladies and gentlemen. This is teaching people that the system is going to give you something free when it's not. Yeah, I'm going to try to define as trans-black. if that's the case, Oh, but then I can't be. This is all just to get us at each other's throats, ladies and gentlemen. This is all psychological warfare. and yes, yes, there will be reparations. in this country. They're going to sell the social credit score and the universal basic income, saying minorities deserve it and every group will have some reason they deserve it. And with the $1,000 or $2,000 a month you get as inflation gets worse, the $50,000 you get, you won't be able to even pay for your apartment or a car or food with that. That's inflation. But you don't worry. Yes, on the path we're on, you will get the reparations. Hey, I wonder if all the kids getting killed in the womb. I wonder if they're going to get reparations. Oh no, Well, they don't count. So this is a sick plan and we're right here in the middle of it and the big think tanks of the CIA have cooked all of this up. Now I'm going to go to break in this little no-man's land five minutes that some stations don't care. I'm going to air a very important clip from the Congressional House Oversight Committee hearing confirming over $10 million of laundered money from the Chinese Communist given to the Biden family, and it's all hidden in plain view.

Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. it's Alex Jones, From the front lines of the information war. it's Alex Jones. The Biden family, frankly, is just a web of concealment, of deception. A lot of people would say corruption. but let's be very clear. You have this many companies involved, this velocity of transactions, size of transactions. Like my colleagues have said, this is not how normal businesses operate. I had the ability, with Chairman Comer and other members of the committee, to go over to the Treasury Building and review documents And, having read those documents, one thing became pretty crystal clear: that there were many people who had serious questions about the transactions and about the velocity of these transactions, And they either get very, very deep into concealment, hiding money, shifting money, And for the purpose we don't know. because one thing everybody in this room and the American people definitely know is that the Biden family doesn't really have a business. There is no business structure around this family except politics, And since Joe Biden has spent decades in the Senate, served eight years as Vice President and is now President of the United States, and the family is getting money from various countries and foreign businesses through various shell companies and this web of LLCs- I mean, guys, you in the press, this is easy pickings. I'm giving you Pulitzer stuff here. All you have to do is literally look at our memo and see the level of detail upon which they have created this, And it's very, very frustrating. We have now been able to clearly see that the Biden's associates, like Rob Walker, Eric Sherman- as has been discussed- created at least 16 companies while Joe Biden was Vice President of the United States. 16 companies created while he was Vice President. Now the list is 20.. And as we continue our investigation, that list is growing And, like I said before, the question is to serve what purpose And the purpose of all these companies being created is to conceal money that the Biden family has been gaining because Joe Biden has been sitting at the upper echelon of our politics for almost five decades. That is the entire purpose here. Here's an example of what I mean. You have Rosemont Seneca Partners, Rosemont Seneca Advisors, Rosemont Seneca Technology Partners, RSP Holdings, RSTP2 Alpha, RSTP2 Bravo, Rosemont Seneca Thornton, Rosemont Seneca Bohai- I want to make sure I pronounce it right- Bohai, B-O-H-A-I, And the list goes on and on. Cycling through this many companies serves no legitimate purpose And as somebody who actually worked in banking, I did that long before I came here. Whenever there was like this, many companies just laying all over the place and you see wire transfers, cashier checks over here going to random members of the family for no apparent purpose. at the size and velocity at which all of this was being conducted, the only logical conclusion of a financial professional is: you are concealing money. Let me restate this: You are concealing money from either the IRS or from credit agencies or from other people in general. That's the only reason you set up a structure like this. Some of these companies were connected to Hunter's Personal Professional Company, Oswego, or Skinny Atlas, Scale Atlas, however you want to pronounce it, And the list goes on and on. And Mr Biggs, he talked about Hudson West III and some of those other issues that were going on as well. One thing I want to make sure is that all of this has happened, and Joe Biden is aware. Nobody in this room can logically sit here and say that the president of the United States had no idea that these companies were being formed while he was vice president of the United States, And I will ask you, he was probably in better mental shape then than he is today. You know, I'll throw that out there. And so what this committee is going to continue to do is pursue this investigation. We are going to continue to document and we're going to provide that information to all of you in the press. So to help you and frankly, you know, like Congressman May said, and probably help the DOJ along with their investigation, One quick note: it's interesting that the Department of Justice has been investigating Hunter Biden for quite some time And we seem to just never really get anywhere. All right, The full press conference is about 45 minutes long. We're posting it at Infowarscom on the live show feed. Our special guest joins us on the other side, Scott Bennett. This is going to be extremely informative And this information can save our republic. We'll be right back in 60 seconds. Please give me one minute of your time. Please write this down and please go look this up. It will change your life.

We're very honored to have him with us. Ex-US Army PsyOps expert. Fox News fired Carlson to maintain semi-lobotomized, quasi-retarded population. Paul Joseph Watson wrote a week or so ago. former US Army psychological warfare officer says that Tucker Carlson was fired by Fox because of the regime's agenda to maintain a uniform semi-lobotomized, quasi-retarded population. close quote: Remarks were made by US counterterrorism expert, Scott Bennett, who is a hero. You look at the Clintons and Obama and the Fast and Furious and the guns to Al Qaeda and ISIS and the money laundering and the Clinton Foundation. we know about a lot of it because of Scott Bennett and just like they're trying to put me in prison and Roger Stone and Elon Musk and Donald Trump. they put him in prison but he was vindicated. He's been vindicated. I'm not going to go over his lengthy anti-terrorism background, but it is substantive. I know he doesn't want to talk about his curricula vitae, but he should probably spend a few minutes about himself. Folks that don't know who he is. he's a US Army Special Operations Officer, 11th Psychological Operations Battalion, Civil Affairs Psychological Operations Command, Global Psychological Warfare Counterterrorism Analyst. It just goes on for hours And his website is shellgamewhistleblowercom. shellgamewhistleblowercom, I'm going to try to give you the floor to go where you want with this, but obviously Tucker Carlson is just a window into this larger real world. You see the congressional hearings the last two months where now they admit what we already experienced: Hell. I watched the congressional hearings, Armed Services Committee of the House saying I'm a Russian agent, I've experienced the CIA, I've experienced the PSYOPs. Now there's other white hat groups that have really helped us and we've broken a lot of information. So the government's not the enemy, but criminals have hijacked it at the top. It's like if you're on a plane and a guy pulls out a bomb and puts the captain's uniform on, That's not the captain. So the airline and the pilots aren't our enemy. He's tied up. We got people that have hijacked the country So he can give us a window into Obama legalizing what 10 years ago congressionally using domestic propaganda. here Now you're seeing the full extent of that. and then the restrict act saying they'll put us in jail. and they're resurrecting the new Ministry of Truth run by US intelligence agencies pointed at the American people. So what brought down Rome, what brought down Venezuela, what brought down Germany having your intelligence agencies and your military against you, has now happened. It's called cultural, political, national cancer is how I would describe it. So, Scott Schell, GameWhistleblowercom. thank you so much. I'm going to try to let you talk as much as you like. 35,000 foot views. Start with Hunter Carlson, a big pitcher, all your travails, everything you said being vindicated, now coming out. Can we unseat this coup without violence? What do you think their next tricks are? There's a million places to go with your expertise. I hope you'll join us again soon. an hour's not enough. maybe we can do a commercial-free podcast sometime for two hours, maybe fly you down here. But congratulations on your work, sir, and being vindicated. So where would you like to start? Well, let's start with the word of the Lord. He says: when a man's ways please the Lord, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him. And blessed be the Lord, my strength, who teacheth my hands to war and my fingers to fight. And I was just down in Texas and I'll say, if all the republics of the world shall fall, Texas will be the last man standing. And it's an honor to be on your show, Alex. I just wanted to put that on there for white purposes. I was an army officer, direct commission psychological operations. because of my advanced degrees. I was at the State Department Counterterrorism Office under General Del Daly, Joint Special Operations Command. I worked in Joint Military Information Support Command, Crystal City, in a secret building on a secret floor. I was also at MacDill. I had a TSSEI clearance, so I was in the highest levels of counterterrorism. Before that I was in the Bush administration. Before that I was at the Heritage Foundation. So Tucker and I sort of had some parallels. He was grown up in La Jolla, I grew up in Laguna Beach, California, but I went out to Washington DC in 1998 to do the good fight and it was there that I sort of cut my teeth in government and think tanks and went into the military as a direct commission. I specialized in psychological warfare, counter-Islamic theory. CIA had picked up some papers of mine. I was known in the community and when I went into Booz Allen, Hamilton and Special Operations Command- to make a long story short- I started seeing the direct connection between Union Bank of Switzerland, the Clinton Foundation, a law firm called Covington & Burling, Eric Holder, Lanny Breuer, Barack Obama and a whole assortment of colorful clown characters from the Obama administration. and I filed reports and I gave briefings and the next thing I know I'm arrested at the front gate and told I filled out my housing form improperly. I thought it was a CIA test but it wasn't. it was a deep state reaction to the explosive suppositories that I seemed to be inserting into their gullet and they threw me in jail for making a false statement on a housing form because they said I circled the wrong bubble. but in reality White Hats had been directing me and had said: Scott, you're going to be going in and it was to track a Swiss banker that a colleague of mine, Ed Snowden, had been tracking. Ed and I were at Booz Allen together. he was in Hawaii, I was in Crystal City in the Pentagon and the Swiss banker was the key to 19,000 bank accounts, hundreds of millions of dollars at the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama and a guy named Robert Wolf, chairman of UBS, were using in financing black operations from Syria to Libya, to Ukraine, to Iraq, and that report came out in Shell Game and that's on the website. people can go there and see it. Shell Game is a military whistleblowing report that was sent to Congress. there's a chapter called Follow the Money and you see all of the congressmen and senators that received a copy of it: Mike Pompeo, Jeff Sessions, among many, many others- and absolutely nothing was done, And I wrote it as a military officer who had been shanghaied by the Obama administration, and Michael Isikoff and Tom Hamburger, two CIA journalists, came up and debriefed me. I then had my family's homes broken into and their safes stolen. so, yes, there were some nefarious overlaps. but we wrote the Shell Game report, we sent it out and, to make another long story short, Alex, my connection with UBS and direct intel in Hong Kong and elsewhere built up a dossier which I gave to President Trump and many others. I even in fact gave it to. I was at a conference in Dallas and I met Sidney Powell and Joe Flynn- and this is when General Flynn had just been incarcerated and I said: you know, the law firm your brother's using, Joe, is a terrorist financing law firm they're stabbing in the back. he has to fire them. and next thing, you know, I told it to Sidney Powell too- General Flynn fired Covington and Burling and hired Sidney Powell, and Sidney Powell contacted me and asked for more information on Covington. and then I wrote an amicus and she submitted a brief and the Justice Department dropped all charges because she said: I'm the new attorney and I want to know everything that's been said between Covington and Burling and the Department of Justice, and they didn't want it to know that they had an incestuous relationship and that they had stabbed General Flynn in the back. so that's why he's free, that's why he's alive, because the Justice Department didn't want this connection known between their law firm that finances and is the legal cover for UBS, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the Chinese Communist Party- all sorts of bad operations. so that's just a General Flynn sideway. The UBS connection is extraordinarily significant because I was invited back to be part of Donald Trump's election analytics team where we looked at the election fraud, the documents, the algorithms, and I had special intel coming to me from a variety of sources I won't go into, but I put together a briefing that showed how Union Bank of Switzerland entered into a contract with the Chinese Communist Party going back to 2009,. that evolved from 2009 up until 2020, where UBS and the Chinese Communist Party created UBS LLC and then worked through Staple Street Capital to acquire Dominion, ES&S and Premier voting machines. That was a direct national security threat to the United States. it shows a foreign entity influencing our elections by purchasing the voting machines. We know the algorithmic impregnation that occurred later, but that's the Union Bank of Switzerland-Chinese Communist Party connection to Dominion, ES&S and Premier, And that's all incredibly important and I want you to continue. and then I want to look at the current landscape and the psyops. I mean I've seen other former and current CIA defense intelligence, other people on the air Last year an incredible series of reports on OAN where they explained that some of these guys actually developed these tactics that they said were too extreme and dangerous to even use on Muslims and in the Middle East and in Central Asia. but then they're using these incredibly dangerous systems here domestically and we can see it everywhere. Everything's a giant psyop right now and I'll get your view on how it's going for the globalists, where you think they're going to go, how we counter it, the collapsing border, kind of a 35,000-foot view of where the republic is right now. Does he really respect your view? Absolutely, absolutely Well, UBS and the connection of the election analytics I presented- and this is significant too, Alex. One of the documents I presented was AFL-CIO connection to senior executive service and their planning of the January 6th event and all sorts of other nefarious activities. So we gave a briefing ahead of January 6th and advised President Trump to engage military operations because they were going to try and overthrow the government and they did, And so let's slow down. Let's go back to the AFL-CIO. how they did it? We know Trump asked for 10,000 National Guard. Milley threatened to basically resign. So this all historically happened, and I know that you were the guy that they're warning him, so let's flesh that out. Well, the AFL-CIO had prepared a document that they shared with 10 people across the nation- high-level legal minds- and this document described how they were planning on disruptive operations and they had connected with senior executive service and other parties, which, to me, is a seditious conspiracy and an act of treason for which they should be executed, after due process of law, of course. But this briefing was presented to Pat Byrne, General Flynn, Sidney Powell, Rudy Giuliani and an assortment of other people close to Trump, and I emphatically advised and warned: this is a war, This is a guerrilla operation, This is asymmetric war. They are engaging in the same tactics of burn, destroy that they've been doing in Wisconsin: burning down cities. We need to engage them and call them domestic terrorists. Well, for a variety of reasons, it wasn't done the right way and the domestic terrorists came up on January 6th with Ukrainian operative thugs that they had used in the overthrow of Ukraine, the overthrow of Yanukovych back in 2014.. We know that biolabs and all the other things of Ukraine. I was part of that documentary too, but they came in and disrupted just January 6th as a SIOP. You're talking about psychological operations. The SIOP of January 6th was to traumatize the Congress, in a sense, into giving them justification to rush through the false, fake president Joe Biden as certification of the votes and to brand every Trump supporter, every Republican, every conservative as a domestic terrorist, Which Biden then, in June of 2021, officially made the main US directive for counterterrorism, saying white supremacism is the number one threat, then defining white supremacism as not wanting lockdowns, not wanting forced shots, not wanting open borders and anything else they deem as bad. Now that is white supremacism, and now you've been labeled a terrorist so they can then try to use the entire apparatus against you. That's right and amplifying. that is the mental degeneration from the COVID-19 vaccine that is lobotomizing everyone who gets it before they die- A slow blood clot, infertile death, which we know is happening from Senator Ron Johnson and other reports, and I think anyone with a brain understands that bioweapon which I would argue has been originated in the Ukrainian operations: 46 biolabs, not just 11, 46 that the Russians- And remember how last year they denied that and said it was Russian disinfo- Now Victoria Nuland testifies to Congress that indeed those are bioweapon labs. Yes, they are, and they've been developing strains of pathogens and diseases that would be aerosolized and delivered against Russian-speaking populations in eastern Ukraine for the purposes of disintegrating the population centers and advancing a low-intensity conflict against Russia. and for that reason Russia stepped in- and I think you know I'm not a Putin apologist at all, but I am a true speaker and a traditional family values conservative- and I see Russia was forced to go in and stop this biolab war that we were initiating under NATO and the European Union. and again, Victoria Nuland, John Kerry, Barack Obama, Joe Biden And another significant aspect of the Ukrainian situation, Alex, which you know well too, is the biochemical labs were funded by Rosemont Seneca Metabiota. one of the organizations that was responsible for a lot of the experimentations as a government contractor was previously called Global Viral Forecasting Institute, and you've got Paul Pelosi Jr, you've got Christopher Hines, you've got Hunter Biden, you've got an association of these. you know children of the greatest criminals this government's ever produced, involved with the chemical biolabs in Ukraine that were creating things that one could argue were shipped back to Chapel Hill, which was one of the contractors on the intelligence documents, then to Fort Detrick and then Wuhan and this whole shell game of moving things around occurred. but it really originated in the Ukrainian operation and that is why Joe Biden and his puppet handlers, I should say the Obama administration- third term Obama- is really behind the curtain- is the little man with his Michael LaVaughn Robinson standing next to him. Obama is the one pulling the strings of Joe Biden. and the massive money laundering, the massive corruption, the massive child trafficking, the criminality in Ukraine is voluminous and you know another reason that they're engaging in this war and FTX. there's another card to play. they're doing massive money laundering and I want to walk through all that, but give me your 35,000 foot view. they admit they're trying to destabilize. Klaus Schwab says: you'll own nothing, you'll have nothing. they are erasing the border. they're flooding us with fentanyl. they are brainwashing our children. they're financing race war. the globalists are launching this war with Russia while they at the same time attack America, which is hurting the dollar. I mean, obviously I know they want to bring down some and then use that collapse as the saviors to come out on top, but I don't actually see it even going well for them. the whole world's starting to wake up. people are turning against them, but they seem to only be doubling down. or you think the globalists are winning right now. I think you're right that the American people are the leaders in so many ways of the world because of their strength of heart, and I don't say that arrogantly, I don't say that with exceptionalism or any of the slogans, but the American people have been on the land that God put us on and we're especially blessed. and I think the best of the Americans, which you know, I think largely- are an audience from your show, ironically enough, the best Americans, the smartest Americans, the toughest Americans, those Americans that cherish their God, their family, their land, have woken up. they haven't let themselves be poisoned with this shot. they're not letting their children be poisoned by the brainwashing of wokeism, rainbow flags, transgender surgery, which is really a form of child sacrifice. we are rising up as separate entities, separate leaders, separate voices, and that's going to carry the day. Alex is for individual counties and towns and states to say no. we're not accepting the jurisdiction of Joe Biden, we're not accepting him as a president, in our school district, in our county supervisor, and that's the good news. people recognize he's not real. it's the third emission of Obama. football teams, basketball teams, college and NFL- everyone's refusing the visits. the players are saying we're not going and they try to order them to go. they won't go. that's never happened before. people recognize this isn't real. That's been what has been required. is this awakening, this transformation, this sense of loss. you cannot get into a fight until you've had everything stripped of you, until you have been completely purged of the materialism, until you have been slapped awake out of your numb fuzzy intoxication, from football games on the weekend to all sorts of leisure and intoxicants which are part of the PSYOP. people are ineffective in political combat until they have been starved of that and purged of that and fasting from that. and I think we've had a fast from you know the real Reagan-Trump leadership for the past two years. No, but I totally agree with you and used to, I would get persecuted and I didn't like it, but I fought through it. I'm not a masochist, but now I know that's, I'm over the target. now I enjoy the pain and it's been quite the process and I'm not trying to brag. I'm just saying it's the Holy Spirit. but now I enjoy it. actually it's wild and it's like a V for Vendetta, where V's putting her through that psychological operation and he says, all right, well, you're not going to turn your friends in, I'm going to kill you. she goes, kill me. he goes, he opens the door and he says: you're free now. I think that's the point a lot of people are getting to. is that what you're saying? Yeah, they're waking up and they're finding their strength. you know, the joy of the Lord is your strength. we're to be joyful, happy warriors. we don't submit to their rainbow flag woke-ism. we don't submit to any of their tyranny. we're not a racist country. we're not a bigoted country. all of that is propaganda and psyop. so we're seeing states break up too. I think you're going to see a reorganization of the national republic. you're going to have some areas like New York and Chicago and elsewhere that are just going to disintegrate into the swamp of their own decadence and violence and stupidity and madness. but then you've got great states and republics like Texas, like Florida, like the Midwest, who are? you know, people are leaving California and elsewhere to be among their tribe and it's not a white thing. there's blacks, there's Hispanics, there's Asians, every tribe that cherishes traditional family values and God and our rights that are protected under the Second Amendment, our rights given to us by God. our Second Amendment right is our right to defend ourselves, defend our country from government tyranny, not from rabid deer. all of these rights are forming the foundation upon which a new republic, I think, is rising and people need to be prepared for that. and that's what makes an exciting time is: in the end, you know, we rise up. it is the V for Vendetta moment. we're rising up with great strength and we're inoculated- to use that term loosely- against the lies of the deep state. Now I do anticipate they're going to accelerate their international conflicts to try and create the smoke and fire to cover their own domestic terrorist agenda here in the United States with Iran or Russia or China. I've been to Iran twice. it is not an enemy of the United States. it is a great Christian population that is rising in Iran. the same with Russia. traditional family values, That's right. I've seen polls that upwards of 80% of people below 25 are pro-American Iran. Same thing in Russia. they're smart enough to know they've got leaders that they don't like, but they understand we're still the best house in a bad neighborhood. Yeah, they do. that's a good way of framing it, and they have a love for America. When I was in Iran, I saw smiles and joy. I never had a sour look, I never had any feeling of negativity and I was there with other former government officials. you know I won't go into names, Scott, stay there. we got to go to break. you got so much to share with us today. incredible guest got to get him back on again soon. amazing.

The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability is lack of real, pure iodine in the body. as they bomb us with the bad halogens, bromine, bromide, chlorine and so much more. Upwards of two billion people in a Lancet Medical Journal study in 2007, worldwide have cognitive disabilities because they don't have high-quality iodine.

Infowars, tomorrow's news today. This is their big move. So yeah, you say why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States? He doesn't care. That's not his job. He's not the president of the United States, He's a puppet operating for the globalists. Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased. They must be opposed, And that's who he works with. Autocrats only understand one word: no, no, no, Exactly. And that's why we say no to your vaccines. No, we will not take my vaccines. We say no to you shutting down our businesses. We say no to you taking our firearms. We say no to you censoring our free speech. We say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization. We say no to you getting us into World War III. You're right. We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden, and we say no And we say no to your war Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. it's Alex Jones. If you think things are bad now, we've just begun to pull the curtain back. I'd say it's back 20%. What are we going to see once it's fully down? I don't see the globalists surviving this, but how do we not let them take us down with them? Scott Bennett, former Army psychological operations officer and a real patriot, is giving us incredible analysis. We're going to get his take here in just a moment, but here's a metaphor and an allegory of what we're dealing with. Thanks, sir. We've done what you told us. We brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West. We melted her. Oh, you liquidated her. eh, Very resourceful, Yes, sir. So we'd like you to keep your promise to us. if you please, sir, Not so fast, Not so fast. I'll have to give the matter a little thought. Go away and come back tomorrow. Tomorrow, Oh, but I want to go home now. You've had plenty of time already. Yeah, Do not arouse the wrath of the great and powerful Oz. I said: come back tomorrow. If you are really great and powerful, you keep your promises. Do you presume to criticize the great Oz? You ungrateful creatures? Think yourselves lucky that I'm giving you audience tomorrow instead of 20 years from now. Oh, The great Oz has come. Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. The great Oz has spoken. Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain. The great Oz has spoken. Who are you? Oh, I am the great and powerful. Two days ago, at the Berkshire Hathaway meeting that Bill Gates was at with Warren Buffett, one of the major shareholders got up and exposed them and Jeffrey Epstein, their whole evil plan. They had him arrested, But that's not a sign of their strength, That's a sign of their weakness. So, the curtains being pulled back, What are we really going to find on the other side? It's already so horrible. And how do we peacefully stop these people? I'm going to shut up and give Scott Bennett the floor here. Scott, please continue. Well, you know, previously you'd asked about Tucker Carlson. Alex and I had the good pleasure of meeting Tucker Carlson at the San Francisco studio he came out to broadcast at And I would do broadcast from the studio too. So it was Tucker myself, his makeup girl and a friend of his wife's, And I gave him a copy of my book Shell Game, And I said, Tucker, you know, be careful with this because CIA and all sorts of operations have come against me. But I told him my credentials and background And Tucker looked at it and he read through it and he thumbed it and he goes: huh, okay, okay, You know, it is Tucker way. And we talked for a little while about everything that happened to me And the 35,000-foot view of what was really going on with the Obama administration and Biden and terrorist financing and UBS and all sorts of operations, And he changed after reading that book. He kind of acquired a serrated edge. So Tucker has been growing and evolving and I think prayer goes a long way And people really need to know that prayer is the most powerful weapon in the universe. So I want to encourage people to pray for you personally, Alex, to pray for your people and your staff and your channel. Pray for me. We are rising to serve our country, to serve out of loyalty and love to our Constitution, our family, our liberties. We are rising up and sacrificing for a greater good because our Heavenly Father is calling us to this fight And this is also a fight that's intergenerational. When you played that clip of Dorothy and Toto, the thought came to me: one of the most powerful things that can happen, that can set the deep state in their minions, their priests, of woke-ism and transgenderism and every evil thing, and school boards and such the most powerful PSYOP is for a young boy or girl between 12 and 14,, 15, to go in- even younger than that if they're skilled- to go in and speak and say: my name is Betsy Sue and I do not want to become a boy. I do not want to cut my breasts off. My name's Johnny and I don't want to cut my penis off and become a girl. And I'm offended that you're trying to push this down my throat. I'm offended when I see books about little boys being raped by men in the shower. I'm offended and disgusted by you. And God says: vengeance is mine, I shall repay. God says it is better for you to have a millstone tied around your neck and cast into the farthest parts of the sea For a child to stand up- maybe that's a child shall lead them. for a child to stand up and roar. the righteous are as bold as a lion. for them to stand up and make these declarations to serve them notice as part of the legal documentation I always train people in. serve them notice that they are doing evil and will be punished eternally for it, as well as in this terrestrial plane as America rises up and reclaims our states and our federal government and our agencies. This is the way to make them fall backwards. This is the way to make school boards run in terror, for the evil they're doing is by little people, small people, young children, going to the podiums and declaring with righteous boldness, with the strength of Samson, that they just won't tolerate this brainwashing. being pushed into their schools for a woke agenda of these old people over 40 or 50 that have never been married, that don't know what a man or a woman is, some purple haired, multiple pierced, rainbow flag worshipping lunatic from San Francisco that happens to move into a school and corrupt a school board in Texas or Idaho, Of course I don't think Texas allows them. This is the way to fight back is by going into your counties, going into your school boards with groups of people. We've got an entity on our website, globalfreedomtvcom, called the Constitutional Law Enforcement Committee. This is a committee people can form. It's like the committees of safety, but it's about going and saying we are not allowing anything that violates the Constitution in our county, in our school boards, and we will sue you civilly and criminally for corrupting a minor. You're teaching religion when you teach transgenderism and the Constitution says you will not establish and teach a religion And that's right. And now they even have New York Times articles admitting transgenderism and the fake environmental movement is the new leftist state religion. And look, Texas is okay compared to some states, but Austin's totally captured. It's just as bad. They parade the elementary students around at the LGBT events. It's all happening. But what you said about Tucker is absolutely true. I'm not going to get into inside baseball, but he was never anti-Christian. He's talked about this. He was Episcopalian. He wasn't sure about it all, but he really knows good and evil. now He's had experiences and knows the truth and that's why they really came after him. He was enlightening Americans. He was coming from a moderate position, a curious position, an intellectual position. He had been at Heritage. Heritage is a wonderful think tank. I was there. It teaches you the conservative encyclopedia of reading, from Sowell to Burke to Elliott to all sorts of other authors. and Tucker was a rational thinker, an academic, an intellectual who was testing and hypothesizing and theorizing. He had brilliant people, from Jordan Peterson to a variety of other authors and speakers, who were happy warriors of truth. And he also- I'm going to break again here in a moment, but what you say is so key here that it's a process of realizing there really is good and evil and the system doesn't want us to be able to differentiate that. And you get back to local government. You're a former military officer, psyops expert and you're explaining. it's the people, it's what the feds are scared of, it's what Obama's third term tried to sick the FBI, the people at school board meetings, because this is our country, this is our nation and if we simply occupy it peacefully and say no to them, they can't win. but they want to bully us and intimidate us, to bow to them as if they're the moral authority. They're not the moral authority. You're right. You're serving them notice. The most powerful thing someone can say is be advised. you're hereby served legal notice. You're violating my rights under 18 US Code, 241 and 242, deprivation of rights under color of law and conspiracy to deprive me of my rights. You can be criminally charged and thrown in jail for five years, ten years. I'm also warning you and serving you notice of 42 US Code, 1983, 84, and 85, civil rights violations. I'm giving you notice now, Mr Police Officer, Mr Government Official, Mr FBI, and I will sue you personally and your agency and your field office for violating my rights. All right, stay there, Scott Bennett, stay with us. I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had.

Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers to convert these gases into fluorosilicic acid, Still highly toxic but containable Now. these companies had a stockpile of this poison And there was no affordable way to dispose of it. Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the Secretary of the Treasury, who was responsible for the Public Health Service at the time, And by 1950, the US government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste product and dumping it into our drinking water.

Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order: it's Alex Jones. I must have dreamed a thousand dreams been haunted by a million screams. I can hear them marching feet. they're moving into the street. I can hear them marching feet. they're moving into the street. I can hear them marching feet. they're moving into the street. I can hear them marching feet. they're moving into the street. I can hear them marching feet. they're moving into the street. I can hear them marching feet. they're moving into the street. I can hear them marching feet. they're moving into the street. I can hear them marching feet. they're moving into the street. I can hear them marching feet. they're moving into the street. I can hear them marching feet. they're moving into the street. I can hear them marching feet. they're moving into the street. I can hear them marching feet. they're moving into the street. I can hear them marching feet. they're moving into the street. I am concerned that you're right. the globalists are in desperation. Prayer is changing things and we're rising up And remember this: the left, the transgender, the rainbow flag. as much as we pray for the salvation of souls, some of these people are going to go homicidal, lunatic, mad dog, crazy, And they're all into their demonic agenda. So there are portions of the population that are going to even become more zombified, violent, subhuman, if you will. What I see happening on a political pragmatic level is the bringing in of Gavin Newsom into replace Kamala Harris. Either they'll get rid of her one way or another. They'll move Gavin Newsom into the vice presidency. Then they will either kill or take out Joe Biden and slip Gavin Newsom in ahead of 2024.. And then they'll try and suspend the elections and say we're suspending it because some Trump supporter person is engaged in domestic terrorism. I think they're going to bring in Gavin Newsom and that's their plan. They've been doing false flag shootings. Nashville was a false flag shooting. You put up that picture of the shooter with two different pairs of tennis shoes. I think they're amplifying, trying desperately to do false flag shootings to try and trigger a Second Amendment disarming of America. But as you know, Americans aren't going to fall for that. They're never going to surrender their right to keep and bear arms. That's just a confirmation. We got lunatics running around killing everybody. We know we're not doing that. We do that for defense, Just like this guy used a truck to kill a bunch of people in Brownsville. We don't give our trucks up because he used a truck. bad, Yeah, yeah. So they're going to be increasingly desperate and violent and crazy. And you know we have to break it down to the small county, town levels. Your sheriff is the most important law enforcement officer. Your sheriff should be saying: not a single FBI agent, not a single DEA agent or any ATF agent shall be coming into my county to do anything to my citizens without a warrant, a wet ink warrant, a warrant and asking permission. That's how we take the country back is through small sheriffs, small local groups. You define this tyranny And I would also say the border is going to be overrun by 700,000 to a million people. The border states need to declare: not a single bus, not a single plane will be transferred across Texas lines or Arizona lines or New Mexico lines. We will stop the bus, stop the plane, arrest the bus driver for violating 1382- illegal entry of an alien into the United States. These border states need to shut down this entire invasion that the federal government is trying to facilitate. I was about to say I talked to super high level federal officials just the last three weeks and they were explaining that they will have people smuggling- a busload of people who are convicted pedophiles. They were giving examples and the Justice Department will not allow them to charge them with human smuggling. They'll say too much for illegal entry And then they let the person out. I mean, it's just, it's total criminal activity, total enablement. They need to break it down and arrest them on a on a small level. Texas needs to arrest them. Arizona needs to forget the federal government, forget the federal law enforcement. There is no law enforcement. There is no justice. There is no respectable FBI or court system anymore. Look at what they've done to Donald Trump. This is a confirmation that the country has gone rogue. We've had a communist takeover, a coup d'etat on January 6th and we've been in a train wreck ever since. And this flooding of the border, the invasion of military aged men from Central America, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama- all these areas are really the dregs of the society of those areas. They're bringing in the dregs across into America and you will see an explosion of crimes and horrors unlike any other time in the history. For that reason, every veteran group, every National Guardsman, every Civil Air Patrol, Devil Dog, Sea Cadet, every militant component of a state's authorities need to be mobilized to defend against this and say, in a sense: to hell with what the federal government says or does. We are defending the land of Texas. Texas borders will not be violated by a single invader and we are not giving jurisdiction to the CIA or the FBI or the ATF or the Border Patrol to do anything. This is Texas land and we're stopping it right here and now. That's what needs to happen. We can't allow this kind of invasion, because they're going to go up into every other state. They're going to go to Idaho, go to Vermont, go to North Dakota, go to Ohio, go to Missouri. That was my next question. Biden and Obama wanted to break the border and said: surge it when he got elected or stole the election, but they've broken it too good. This is even out of control for them. I mean, the flood they created is absolutely waking people up. Well, you create a buffer zone, You electrify the fences, You send the military down there, You shut it down like it was an invasion, And then people know to stop coming instead of saying come And you go down into South America, into Central America, with special operations teams and you disrupt the flow, You disrupt the parades, You disrupt their vehicles by all means necessary. We had the gullible president last week trying to get ahold of Biden. He wouldn't even talk to him. and then Kamala Harris is on the job. She's going to run the AI task force. Give me a break Telling her this was happening. and of course, they don't take the call because they're behind it. Texas, Arizona, New Mexico- these states need to be. also volunteers from other states need to come down as special operations- Sicario teams, if you will- and disrupt the invasion from the origin sources. So they need to be going down and flanking these parades and disintegrating And cutting off the UN funding. The US government and the State Department funds UNICEF to do this. Yes, and a variety of other nonprofits are involved in this, and it's an act of treason. Again, you have to take control on your state level. If you had real manly leaders as governors in these states, they would say to their sheriffs: not a single bus or plane crosses Texas territory, period. I want the buses arrested, shut down, take everybody off, load them on a boat, send them somewhere else, but not into Texas And we don't care what the federal government says. You know, in a sense, in a way, we have to declare independence from the acts of treason and tyranny the federal government is doing under the perversion of the Refugee Resettlement Act. Refugees are the Vietnamese that escaped their torture and death under Vietnam. Refugees are not people coming from Central and South America looking for a job. That has been corrupted and perverted. It is not covered under the Refugee Resettlement Law. It has been completely perverted and that is one of the legal justifications. All right, Scott Scott, we've got to go to break. Do one more segment with us. I want to hear your message to people in the system what they can do, because we know it's hijacked at the top, but in the system there's still a lot of good people. I want to talk to you about that. Your book again can be found at ShellgameWhistleblowercom By the same title.

Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds. If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website where they admit the number one cause of cognitive disability in the world is iodine deficiency. The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability is lack of real, pure iodine in the body. as they bomb us with the bad halogens- bromine, bromide, chlorine and so much more. Upwards of 2 billion people in a Lancet Medical Journal study in 2007, worldwide have cognitive disabilities because they don't have high quality iodine. Most iodine is bound to other elements. you don't absorb it. We have X3, all three types of good iodine together that supercharges your body. X3 is now back in stock at InfoWarsTorecom. It's been sold out for over six months for 25% off. X3 back in stock. Take action now, InfoWarsTorecom. Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire food supply. Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element, which has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population, And there are two things we need to do about it. We need to practice more regenerative farming. There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally keep the soil rich with iodine, And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day. Derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the earth's surface, our InfoWars Life Survival Shield X3 is, hands down, the best Pure, nascent iodine, stabilized in an activated triiodine form, For a healthy thyroid and a healthy metabolism. get yours now at InfoWarsTorecom. If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. Alright. our guest is amazing. He's staying with us for another 15 minutes. Some stations don't carry this first five. So I wanted to answer that big question about his message to people in the establishment that don't want to be part of this destruction but don't know what to do. He's one of those guys that went public, went through. a lot has been vindicated. We'll talk about that coming up in about six minutes, But what do you think? I mean, we know about the deep state and the UN replacing migration instead of doing this, But you see the Democrats having to live in the blue cities they've created. They're wrecked. They're wrecking everything And I just don't see. I'm kind of asking you to answer the question now We can continue. next segment. Why is the establishment thinking, Scott, that they're going to be insulated from what they're doing? Tyrants do that throughout history, all the time, But they always get consumed by the crises they create. There is a certain bureaucratic mindset that afflicts the two-dimensional. They don't have any creative adaptability or flexibility. They don't imagine. They just hammer away at their mundane existence and jobs and their mundane minds. So there is a softness and a cauterization that has occurred in their mental processing. They don't think about these things. They're fearful, They're cowardly, They're weak. ultimately, That's what defines a lot of people in the bureaucratic circles. They care about their chunk of cheese and their retirement, But the globalists on top of them are a lot smarter. How do they think they're going to be insulated from this? They're hoping people are going to die off, Alex. They're hoping for all sorts of COVID-19-related mass deaths, mass lobotomizations, mass deterioration of the physical body of humanity. Look at what we have allowed to happen with giving people this COVID-19 vaccine on the military level and the government level. Everybody who got that vaccine, sadly—and I've met Mikovits and a lot of other doctors and scientists— everybody that got that shot, I'm convinced, sadly, is going to demise very, very quickly and possibly with a mental fog. This is what the vaccine does. It's not a vaccine, It's a bioweapon. Let's call it that. I keep having to get corrected. It's a biochemical weapon designed to crush and destroy the DNA of human beings, And everyone who got it- if it wasn't a placebo, sadly- is going to have to process through that. That's, I think, the motivation of why they're trying to rush this through. Look at Europe. They have forcibly jabbed people with this bioweapon. They are forcing people in Europe to eat bugs and worship the climate and worship the rainbow flag. This is an ungodly, evil agenda that the globalists are trying to create a Star Trek world with this delusion Exactly, It's build back better. They say they've got to destroy this world before they build their utopia, but all they're building is hell on earth. They are, It is hell on earth, and that's the difference. We recognize it. We smell the death, We sense the evil behind their animated lies and demonic smiles, And it's causing us to retract and pull back and say: no, we're going to create our own communities, our own tribes, our own regions. aside from this- And I think that's another reason Putin and Russia have stood up and have said: woke is a crime against humanity. Russia wrote into its constitution that marriage is between a man and a woman. Why can't the United States do that? Why can't states do that? Marriage is between a man and a woman. It was created by God for being fruitful and multiply, not for a perverse, you know, masturbatory exercise and all of the other dysfunctions that follow the homosexual, transgender surgical alteration. We're creating a generation of madness And I've said this before too. We are suffering this curse, this affliction, because of the bloodshed and chaos and violence that we've unleashed upon the world for the past 20 years, starting with 9-11.. So Bush and Cheney and these other traitors and Obama and Biden that launched us into this military juggernaut since 2001 onward, We're now reaping the benefit of that curse, or I should say the horrors of that curse. And that is the spiritual moment where people need to. as God says, if my people, who are called by my name, shall humble themselves and praise, I will heal their land. We have to pray for a healing of our land. We have to also stand up. Stay there, sir. Back in 60 seconds On target. Scott Bennett, Please give me one minute of your time. Please write this down and please go look this up. It will change your life. The UN admits, and the Lansing Medical Journal admits, that upwards of 2 billion people have mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities. The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine. Most iodine in the environment is bound to other elements, so your body can't absorb it. Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells, And Infowarestorecom has the only iodine out there that actually has this type of full effect. Ladies and gentlemen, X3 has been sold out for six months. It's very hard to produce and it's finally back in stock. In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.

Take action now, but regardless, research is From the front lines of the information war. it's Alex Jones. All right, we're now into hour number three. Our guest leaves us here. in about 10 minutes I'm going to cover all this other insane news I've not hit yet. At your discretion, we'll be advised. Our team's now in El Paso with Michael Yaun. They'll be reporting throughout the war room today live from the collapse of the border. that's already happened but will accelerate tonight when Title 42 expires at midnight. Scott Bennett was commissioned into the US Army as an officer Special Operations, 11th Psychological Operations Battalion. I don't go over his whole background Shellgamewhistleblowercom. He's got a very important book that's a report to Congress. you should get, In the time we have left, that message to the minions that are just going along with the system out of fear of losing their job, versus the globalists that are in control. 99 plus percent of people are going to be destroyed by this new world order depopulation program. You go back to Carnegie Endowment after World War I. they said the way to have peace is to have tyranny. trigger wars beforehand, depopulate. That decision by the ultra-rich has been made. They don't like looking at masses of humanity. This is their program, But the rest of us going along with it is purely satanic agenda. It's suicidal. Plus, we're designed to stand up and build communities of humanity. It makes us feel good. It's who we are. So, for all the people that have been asleep or serving evil, you're not empowered because you're not being a good person And I think there's always time, except for certain really evil individuals, to turn back. I think that's the story and the truth of Christ on the cross, with one person repented and the other didn't. Or look at Saul of Tarsus on the road to Damascus, So directly addressing those in the system. You already addressed those fighting and it was great advice. But for people out there that have gone down this road of evil so long now, it's so clear that true wickedness runs our government and other major governments. What is your message to them? Well, behold, I am the Lord who heals. Let thy light so shine before men that they see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven. We can all cry out to the Lord, Jesus Christ, to come into our hearts and heal us, And our past sins are all forgiven and forgotten, and our future sins as well, under the blood of Christ. So, even if you are a diabolical, devil, minion, doing all sorts of evil and corruption, and abortions and all sorts of bad things, whatever it is, Christ heals. Christ calls us. The thief on the cross had the moment and God said today you'll be with me in paradise. So Christ is our source and our healing and our support, And he is taking away from us, Alex, the idolatry which America has worshipped for 20,, 30,, 40,, 50 years, And that idolatry is being peeled away from us and we're rediscovering the manna in the desert, our complete dependence on God- And I think that's the real awakening- is he is unleashing this in America and other parts of the world too. So my message to those who were part of the evil cabal or the democrats and such: cry out to God, He will heal you If he knocks open it. Behold, I am the way, the truth and the life. No man cometh to the Father, but by me. There's one name under heaven by which man can be saved, And the most important words, Alex, that people can say: when you go into a supervisor's meeting, when you go into a school board meeting and you go to that podium and speak, or your little child goes, you say: I am an ambassador of the Lord Jesus Christ. He says: be my ambassadors. He is in my heart And I'm telling you right now that any evil, any corruption, any of this perversion that you try and advance, you will be held to account. You will hear the words depart from me: ye, who do iniquity? I never knew you. So be the ambassador, Be bold. Now is the time to be bold, because you're right. They try and intimidate, They try and bully, They try and threaten, They try and say: well, we're the FBI or we'll come after you. You have no power except what my Heavenly Father gives you. Christ said. The federal government, these federal agencies are falling apart. And I'll say this: this border invasion is the one moment where these states have to bind together and say no, we are not going to allow an invasion into the United States that will only get worse and worse and worse and completely corrupt our body politic into a cancer. And we've been saying it's only going to get worse. when Obama accelerated it, Trump stopped it. Now it exploded. I mean, if we think, a million on the border right now about to come in, as bad the numbers are, the UN estimates they want to bring 680 million people here, Yes, Yes, And there is the end of the United States. This is the one time and juncture that the states need to defy this fake Biden presidency and these lunatics in Washington and say no, we are not allowing one bus, one, one train, one plane, one car, one caravan, one donkey to come into Texas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Arizona. We're cutting it off and we're asking all the other states to send their people down and help us man the border. If the federal government won't do it, then the United States of America will do it. We do not need the federal government, We need the hearts and minds of our people and governors to recognize their duty under the Constitution is to protect their people, not other people from every other third world. And we know, we know. in the 80s they came to Reagan, who overall was a good guy. He got misled some and presented him a martial law plan under a collapsed border. He said no, but they are definitely resurrecting Rex 84.. Yes, yes, they have. Reagan was wrong in that original amnesty that they've done. But this is, this is a world changing event. Alex, No one really. You said it well. They're going to flood this country with every third world population person so that there is no United States of America. You have an escape from New York. you know District nine, garbage heap And you think little girls being snatched off the street while they're on their little scooters wearing pink dresses is not going to happen. You have another thing coming: These cartels are going to transition their economies into human trafficking, sex trafficking, and they're going to target the little girls in your neighborhoods and your little boys very quickly. This is going to turn into a nightmare if it is not stopped by every veteran. Oh, it's already begun. I mean, child kidnapping is off the charts and it barely hits the news. People go to a Mavericks game and eight year old girls get grabbed and are found two weeks later with over 100 men raping them in Oklahoma City. I mean, it's just insane. They're putting fentanyl on kids arms and little girls outside targets and grabbing and loading them in vans and hits the news one time and get shut down. That's when the Second Amendment comes in. that's when hunter posse groups come in. that's where men and women rise up and say: not in our community, not in our town, not on our street, not in our court. And, by the way, the only safe places in Mexico is where the farmers have illegally gotten guns and started doing that. You have to meet this enemy as an enemy. It is a foreign invading force of demoniacs, MS-13 lunatics with faces covered in tattoos. Yeah, you can say they were trained by CIA in the early days, but they are now invading the United States and it needs to be stopped by all means necessary. And we are in a civil war. We're in a revolutionary war. We've been in a civil war, revolutionary war, since this fake president was pushed in by the PSYOP of January 6th. I saw all the documentation. I was right there in the middle of it And their agenda is to destroy this country, destroy the patriots, destroy those Trump supporting patriots. And again, how does the average FBI- I know most of them are involved with special units, same ones as the Whitmer kidnapping ran January 6th- How do they get these people to do something so evil against their own family? I mean, it's just insane. It's like how do they think what they're doing isn't going to affect them? Like you said, it's two-dimensional thinking. Yeah, A lot of the FBI and these agencies and these police have never been in the military. They've never sworn a note as a military officer or military enlisted The difference between a military person and the police or FBI and such. we've sworn a note to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. That oath does not go away, Whether we're retired, whether you're from Vietnam or Korea or Iraq or anywhere else. this massive pool of veterans between 30 and 90, this is the army of the United States that needs to step in and defend our country, defend our children, defend our families, defend our borders. We need to rise up because the ATF, FBI and these other federal agencies are demonically seduced in a lot of ways. Half these false flag shootings are done with permission of these Masonic entities that are in the police and such. We need to recognize there is no dependency or trust that we can have on any federal force. That's why I would say that states should tell the FBI, ATF- you don't have jurisdiction here. No, that's right. America is a failed state. now We need a new Declaration of Independence, a coalition of states to reconvene and create a new federal government. This current one is totally occupied. Very impressive, Scott Bennett, join us again very soon. Shellgamewhistleblowercom- People should get your book there.

Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order: it's Alex Jones. The video just went live minutes ago. it's on Infowarscom. you can share it. enjoy the Paul Revere's Border Hell Tsunami Unleashed and then I'm going to show you the reality of what's happening to our children. viewer discretion is advised. But here is John Ballin's latest report. One of my journalist sources, who's proven to be extremely accurate, started calling me desperately yesterday morning before the attack in Dallas. He said: do not go to shopping malls and grocery stores, that the two largest drug cartels have not worked together in more than 20 years, have made a deal and are working with the Biden administration to launch terror attacks inside the United States, using operatives where they'll kidnap their mother or their son or their daughter and say: if you don't run people over, if you don't go shoot people, we're going to kill your sister, your daughter, your mother, your father. Originally, when the report came from an insider that was actually in the room, as they say, but at the compound where an unprecedented meeting took place, where the Gulf cartel and the Sinaloa cartel got together. Why is it unprecedented? Well, rival cartels don't typically get together to plan events. they're against each other. they're killing each other. Hours later, what the source told us was imminent happened. The source started calling our other source Friday night. He didn't talk to him until 10.30 in the morning. he checked his phone record. This happened what 1.30, 2 pm in the afternoon. So that's powerful. The more important thing going on, they're going to invest billions of dollars in a new enterprise. The border is not open. We can't treat people like criminals when they're crossing the border. Biden said there's no crisis at the border for two and a half years, He said, surge the border out of control, crime out of control, murder. Now, as the border completely collapses and up to 80,000 people are set to come across on Thursday when Title 42 expires in El Paso alone, suddenly, oh my gosh, it's a giant crisis. This is a manufactured crisis, and a crisis that, manufactured by the Trump administration, Manufactures crises, And the fact is, President Trump must stop holding American people hostage, must stop manufacturing a crisis. We are clear eyed about the challenges we are likely to face in the days and weeks ahead, which have the potential to be very difficult. We are taking this approach within the constraints of a broken immigration system that Congress has not fixed for more than two decades And without the resources we need: personnel, facilities, transportation and others that we have requested of Congress and that we were not given. Recently, the Democrats gathered on the Hill to oppose a measure condemning voting in US elections by illegal immigrants As part of the HR 1 election proposal. rejecting the Republican portion. allowing illegal immigrants the right to vote devalues the franchise and diminishes the voting power of the United States citizens. Instead, opting to support illegal voting currently underway in local elections- And here's how it's going to work- They activate the cartels that do this stuff every few minutes in Mexico, every few hours. They rule by terror. They start shooting people, bombing people, running people over through their operatives, And then Biden comes and says, oh my gosh, we've got to take the Second Amendment And I will secure the border and I'll bring in a new title. Second Amendment is not absolute. Well, the tree of liberty is not water in the blood of patriots. What's happened is, if you want to fight against the country, you need an F-15.. You need something a little more than a gun. No, I'm not joking. Think about this. Think about the rationale we use that's used to provide this. And who are they shooting at, Shooting at these guys behind me? No amendment to the Constitution is absolute. I think this presents us with some significant opportunities to make some real changes, And now's the time when things are shifting. We're going to. there's going to be a new world order. out there, Drug cartels on the surface are angry because of Title 42 gets lifted. They want to have people being deported all the time so they can make money five, six, seven, eight, nine times off of them. And I'm being told that this is nothing. There's going to be a massive wave. There's going to be no doubt about the pressure for Joe Biden Now. this is a total twofold effort. They're going to try to also never let a good crisis go to waste. I mean folks. this goes on in Mexico all the time. The cartels will order, say: take Cancun is controlled by the government, the military, one of the few zones that's somewhat safe- And they don't pay enough protection money. You'll see dozens of robberies, murders a day, bombing, shootings to the cartels. That's what they do. And here in America, if you've got millions of people coming across the European- on average 10,000, 15,000 dollars, the lowest 7000, according to congressional testimony- and I agree with that analysis, that's billions, And so all hell is breaking loose. ladies and gentlemen, All right, full report at BannedVideo and Infowarscom And the viewers doing a great job taking these clips and posting them everywhere.

The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability is lack of real, pure iodine in the body. as they bomb us with the bad halogens- bromine, bromide chlorine and so much more.

I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had. I don't think anybody can deny it- and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us. When we talk about the crew at InfoWars- people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers- they really have been the MVPs in this fight. and when we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day- five, six, seven days a week- it's really just incredible For myself and the whole InfoWars crew. I thank you for your past support and I want to encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us. I know you spread the word. I know you pray for us. That's wonderful, Keep doing it. But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsTorecom and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life while at the same time keeping us on air. I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsTorecom. If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsTorecom, our funding problems will be over. Please take action now. Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government. A flying disk has been found and is now in the possession of the army. There is a bulletin from CBS News: President Kennedy has been shot. This is a different kind of war. The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and torpedo boats. The CIA could manipulate the news in the United States. They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor. It's almost as if there were a plan in full. It just can't end. We need to go into the capital. Death, death, death. You will always have conspiracy theories. They are nothing but distractions. You guys censored Harvard, educated doctors. You silenced those voices. What we want to do in Davos is push the reset button. As soon as we start exposing the Great Reset, the sooner these globalists start going to prison, Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones. You'll want to watch InfoWars updates, all that good stuff, and I'll see you next time. I want to just make this point. The major corporations, the big banks, the media, they're all trying to sexualize our children. They're trying to make it harder, to screw them up and form a relationship with the system and the medical system. And there's major studies out on suicide death, highest rates of people in government studies. So these aren't people being abused because they're transgender, by all the mean people who are trying to reject this attack. This is being done by the system. Now look at this doll. This doll's being pushed all across North America and in Europe. many other dolls like it- Dolls with penises to confuse children and to sexualize children so they become interested in what that is. This is the whole pedophile system. Phalloplasty was invented in 1936 and first performed in 1946 in Russia in a man that had his genitals blown off. And it doesn't work. It creates a mess. It almost always rots and falls off. doesn't have any real feeling in it. The nerves are all dead. How do they do it? Here it is. This is being done to tens of thousands of girls a year in the United States. that quote: want a penis. They cut off the forearm, skin and tissue. This is a girl's forearm. Her muscles have been framed to create a fake phallus that doesn't function until they take the skin and the muscles down to the bone. They will take and make her a fake urethra. She'll probably be incontinent. She will certainly never function like a man and her muscles won't grow back. Google phalloplasty or phalloplasty P-H-A-L-L-O-P-L-A-S-T-Y. okay, There's videos of it being done. I'm not going to show it to you. This is what they call care for young mentally ill individuals: literally cutting off their arm and their tissue to make them a penis, legalizing horrible mutilation. Here's a young woman that's had her breast cut off. This is right out of Hellraiser. You take a closer look at the young girl. you notice a lot of cutting marks from self-harm. This is a sign of severe mental illness and, don't worry, the state's more than happy to complete that for her. This is the fake penis, where they cut off the muscles and the tissue. They then form it Again. in almost all cases it rots off and causes infections and has to be surgically removed within a year on average. They are taking thigh tissue to make the penis. This is the total psychotic government that we have. Washington Democrat Governor Inslee signs controversial bill allowing government to take away minors from parents and not tell them where they are and cut their breasts and uteruses off and cut parts of their arms off. Republicans demand answers after suicides- plural in NIH transgender study and it goes into the high level of suicide with people in the government study. They're literally killing people. They want to euthanize you. This is as close as they can get. but now all over the Western world. they're saying that they are going to. they're not saying it. they're saying, hey, we're going to have state push you to commit suicide and the state's your guardian. when you're mentally ill, We decide to kill you and say you agreed to it. A child or a mentally ill person is out of the age of consent. Texas AG to investigate a hospital that provides irreversible gender transition to minors, cutting their penises and breast off. Absolutely. This is psychotic. This is a cult. Look at this transgender woman right here. Trans woman is cleared of flashing her penis at three. moms using Ohio YMCA for a judge said she's too fat. He's too fat for his genitals to be seen. This is all just pervert planet, ladies and gentlemen. trans Starbucks Marisa screams a customer for misgendering him assaults. man filming the outburst, and it goes on and on. Meanwhile, coming after your children, Chelsea Clinton is working with the WHO and the Gates Foundation that cue that club up from yesterday to have the largest childhood immunization ever. ever in the next year and a half He's also pushing gender queer to be an all elementary and middle schools that teaches children to go with adults that want to have sex with you and have sex with it. have sex with them in the shower or in the back of their car or in a shed, So they're priming children to be kidnapped, in many cases murdered. you know, like this makes no sense. These people are a psychotic demon cult in control. Of course it makes sense. That's who they are, And it just goes on and on. We're also giving us the poison shots. Here's Chelsea Clinton and the Clinton Foundation coming for your children with poison shots. I do think, though, you know, when you ask about the role of public private partnerships, kind of, after the last few years, I think we spend so much time, understandably, focused on the mRNA vaccines and technologies. I spend a lot of time thinking about the really unfortunate- to try to use a not too judgmental word- kind of rise in not only kind of vaccine hesitancy and questioning, but outright kind of rejection of vaccines and of kind of science and the scientific kind of process, And also, too often, on our scientists, our epidemiologists, our frontline health care workers, And so I do think we need to have a much more robust conversation and sense of urgency, because I think we are less prepared today than we were, arguably, in January of 2020, partly because of the kind of lack of trust and confidence in not only our scientists but in science itself And certainly in the public health professionals. And so I think we need the public sector to block the therapeutics and lie to everybody and release the virus and then poison everybody And they admit the shot doesn't work, but it makes you sick or kills you. Science, science, lack of faith in our science, our science, our science are just buzzwords. Oh, you're in a worse position yet because we know you're a bunch of mass murdering pedophiles. Continue with this monster, Certainly in the public health professionals. And so I think we need kind of the public sector to hopefully stop doing things like stripping away public health emergency powers from state public health agencies. Oh, we don't want to strip emergency powers from her wanting to put something in your kids. It's all about rape of children, rape of the future. That's satanism. Continue with this satanist. Help candidly like: do a better job of helping explain kind of the science that you are already commercializing and bringing to market, but also what you're working on Commercializing. they force it, in the broader conversation, not be uncomfortable with the discomfort of uncertainty. Pause again. We know it's well known that child molesters will use a woman to trick kids to get in the van And that's all she is. That's why they put all these women in charge as the spokespersons, as we epigenetically don't see a woman as threatening like a man, And that's all she is is luring you into the truck, luring you into the van, Continue. And so I do think we need really good ideas for how best to do that, because we all deserve to hopefully not be as unprepared as I worry we are at the moment. And the last thing I'll say is a new effort that we're a part of is the new initiative launched by the World Health Organization last week to try to catch kids up on their routine immunizations. In 2021 alone, more than 25 million kids under the age of one missed at least one routine immunization, And so we're working with WHO and the Gates Foundation and others to hopefully have the largest kind of childhood immunization effort ever over the next 18 months to catch as many kids up. Did you hear Webster Hubble's daughter? Because no one should die of polio or measles? Oh yeah, The main death of polio is from the shots. Shut her up. I can't listen to her. Webster Hubble's daughter. Shut her up, Shut her up. So that's the reality. We're going to catch the kids up, Catch them. Yeah, You monster. But God will punish these people, Make no mistake, And everybody hates them. now, Again, there'll be 10 million views on a video, hundreds of thousands of comments. Five of them are pro Bill Gates. Everybody hates you. No amount of censorship will fix it. We know you're a monster. We know you're a killer. We know who you are. Now the Tucker Carlson thing is big and it's important, And the fact that from his house he can have 10 times the viewers of Fox isn't a slight on him, It's a slight on the system and how pathetic they are Now. it's a giant collapsing façade. We're going to hit that. I've also got another important clip with Russell Brand taking Big Pharma to the woodshed and more.

The UN admits and the Lansing Medical Journal admits, that upwards of 2 billion people have mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities. The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine. Most iodine in the environment is bound to other elements, so your body can't absorb it.

Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move against Tucker Carlson and take him off the air. People said, no way. he's the most pop would ever happen. They've got quadrillions of stolen money. They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believe they can control him. But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air. It's the same thing with InfoWars, But InfoWars is not owned by Fox or controlled by George Soros, or owned by Spotify, like Joe Rogan. We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners, And when you support us, we're unstoppable. I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros. I'm underwritten by you, which is we, the people. So I want to thank you for your support and encourage viewers and listeners to understand. Please don't take InfoWars for granted. We're barely hanging on. We need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support, while getting great products at the same time at InfoWarscom. So don't procrastinate. Go to InfoWarscom, get amazing products that keep us on the air and never submit to these tyrants Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. it's Alex Jones. The pandemic created at least 40 new big pharma billionaires. Pharmaceutical corporations like Moderna and Pfizer made $1,000 of profit every second from the COVID-19 vaccine. More than two-thirds of Congress received campaign funding from pharmaceutical companies in the 2020 election. Pfizer chairman Albert Baller told Time magazine in July 2020 that his company was developing a COVID vaccine for the good of humanity, not for money. And, of course, Pfizer made $100 billion in profit in 2022.. And may I just mention finally- and this is also a fact- that you, the American public, funded the development of that. The German public funded the BioNTech vaccine. When it came to the profits, they took the profits. When it came to the funding, you paid for the funding. It's difficult not to, But I will just add one thing: It is possible that these are greedy capitalists who made a lot of money, And also there are a lot of people who did need the vaccine. There are a lot of people who did need the vaccine. I never wanted to be told I was one of them who had to take it- but there are lots of people who needed that vaccine and would be dead without it. That is true too, Bill. That is true too. More facts. All I'm querying is this: Yes, Is, if you have an economic system in which pharmaceutical companies benefit hugely from medical emergencies, where a military industrial complex benefits from war, where energy companies benefit from energy crises, you are going to generate states of perpetual crisis where the interests of ordinary people separate from the interests of the elite. Good evening, my friends, and welcome to an Alex Jones Emergency News Alert, And good evening, Welcome to Tucker Carlson. There isn't just evil in the world, There's also good. And a few weeks ago, Tucker Carlson, with the top news show in the world, got fired from Fox News for telling the truth, And I told you back then I won't bore you with all the videos. Regular listeners saw it. I told you that he would not go with Newsmax. He would not go with the other shows that are free money. He wants to be totally independent and control his new show, because somebody very close to Tucker Carlson told me that And also said: look for him to do a deal with Elon Musk. I'm on record. Viral news stories all over the news. We sang it, It's there, It's on record. So yet again, Infowarscom, Alex Jones, tomorrow's news. today. It is so exciting that in Maine and in Florida he'll be hosting a show 12 months out of the year, weeknights with Tucker Carlson tonight. This is so exciting. And look you say what you want about Elon Musk, but putting Tucker Carlson on the air, who is not going to be censored or controlled, is another major feather in Elon Musk's hat. So we salute Tucker Carlson, We salute all of you, And I want to remind you: his first video he put out a few weeks ago has 25 million views. That's four or five, six times all the viewers that Fox News has every day. His latest video just launched a few hours ago: Millions and millions of views. It'll have 50 million views. This is so exciting. People don't want networks, They don't want corporate establishment, Disney or Hollywood or any of that. They want authenticity, They want reality, They want pro-human information, And Tucker Carlson is the essential example of that, And so is InfoWars. So we're battle-hardened, We're under attack, But you recognize, the fact that we're under attack by these evil forces shows how bona fide and authentic we are. I'm not financed by George Soros, Democratic Party, Republican Party, any of that. I'm financed by you, your word of mouth, your prayer and supporting us at InfoWars4.com. So here is Tucker, from his great compound in Maine, reporting to the world about what he's planning to do. This is so beautiful. It obsesses the system so much. Fox has leaked all this garbage against Tucker. They're trying to put handcuffs on him so he quote- can't be on cable until January 2025. But in his contract he can be online because the big cable giants aren't worried about the Internet. And it'll be even bigger on the Internet, just like Joe Rogan, and we'll then end up on every channel. So Joe Rogan is huge. He's the king of the hill right now And I love Joe. He's a good friend of mine. He lives right here in Austin. Hell Studios is a mile away, But look out. Tucker Carlson is about to go from iconic to game-changing, historic, And I'm just blessed and honored to be here. So we're still at InfoWarscom. We're still on the air every day, seven days a week, 11 am, Central weekdays- InfoWarscom. Here is Tucker Carlson talking about the reality. I told you all this. I said: don't hold your breath, Newsmax. Don't hold your breath. Patrick McDavid, who's a great guy. he's not going to go with somebody else controlling him. He's going to go with an independent platform where he has full control. So if you thought Tucker Carlson was hardcore before, you ain't seen nothing yet. And this is another archetypal Carl Jung story of the hero of a thousand faces. This is happening now. Evil is not the only power in the universe, There's also humanity as well. So here's Tucker Carlson with his big announcement that just came out about an hour ago, going viral now, But regardless, we'll see you weekdays 11 am, Central InfoWarscom. God bless, Hey, it's Tucker Carlson. You often hear people say the news is full of lies, But most of the time that's not exactly right. Much of what you see on television or read in the New York Times is in fact, true in the literal sense. You could pass one of the media's own fact checks. Lawyers would be willing to sign off on it. In fact they may have, But that doesn't make it true. It's not true At the most basic level. the news you consume is a lie, a lie of the stealthiest and most insidious kind. Facts have been withheld on purpose, along with proportion and perspective. You are being manipulated. How does that work? Let's see. If I tell you that a man has been unjustly arrested for armed robbery, that is not, strictly speaking, a lie. He may have been framed. At this point there's been no trial, so no one can really say. But if I don't mention the fact that the same man has been arrested for the same crime six times before, am I really informing you? No, I'm not. I'm misleading you, And that's what the news media are doing in every story that matters, every day of the week, every week of the year. What's it like to work in a system like that? After more than 30 years in the middle of it, we could tell you stories. The best you can hope for in the news business at this point is the freedom to tell the fullest truth that you can. But there are always limits And you know that if you bump up against those limits often enough, you will be fired for it. That's not a guess, It's guaranteed. Every person who works in English language media understands that. The rule of what you can't say defines everything. It's filthy, really, and it's utterly corrupting. You can't have a free society if people aren't allowed to say what they think is true. Speech is the fundamental prerequisite for democracy. That's why it's enshrined in the first of our constitutional amendments. Amazingly, as of tonight, there aren't many platforms left that allow free speech. The last big one remaining in the world, the only one, is Twitter. where we are now, Twitter has long served as the place where our national conversation incubates and develops. Twitter is not a partisan site. Everybody's allowed here, and we think that's a good thing. And yet, for the most part, the news that you see analyzed on Twitter comes from media organizations that are themselves thinly disguised propaganda outlets. You see it on cable news. You talk about it on Twitter. The result may feel like a debate, but actually the gatekeepers are still in charge. We think that's a bad system. We know exactly how it works and we're sick of it. Starting soon, we'll be bringing a new version of the show we've been doing for the last six and a half years to Twitter. We bring some other things too, which we'll tell you about, But for now, we're just grateful to be here. Free speech is the main right that you have. Without it, you have no others. See you soon. Wow, That is so powerful, So iconic Way. better than Tucker in some fancy studio, But in his house, Talking directly to the people. That's what humanity is looking for. And his real focus on justice and freedom and unifying left and right and creating a pro-human, populist movement is so beautiful. It's what we're all looking for. So, again, we salute Tucker Carlson. Thank you so much for this. This is such an exciting moment. It's going to have tens of millions of viewers a day, Probably hundreds of millions, And this is just an example of how evil is not the only power in the world. Freedom is way more powerful if we exercise it. But we've got to exercise it. So, for myself and the crew, we salute Tucker Carlson. We salute listeners and viewers for what we've done together. This is a historic time. This is the new renaissance being born. right now. I'll see you live weekdays at 11 am at Infowarscom for its last show. You better believe we'll be covering Tucker's new exploits that are about to drop and about to make the globals pull their hair out. There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example. Alex Jones Before a conspiracy theorist who is apparently. It's Alex Jones, Scum, Russian scum. Infowars comes to mind. Your reputation is amazing. I will not let you down. You will be very, very impressed. I hope, If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution is laying right there in front of you, hidden in plain view. Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds. If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website where they admit the number one cause of cognitive disability in the world is iodine deficiency. The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability is lack of real, pure iodine in the body. as they bomb us with the bad halogens, bromine, bromide, chlorine and so much more. Upwards of 2 billion people in a Lancet Medical Journal study in 2007, worldwide have cognitive disabilities because they don't have high-quality iodine.

I'm Kate Dally, your guest host from katedallyradiocom, the Kate Dally show. So glad to be with you today. I hope all is well. This will be a pretty informative hour and I really do hope that this hour makes you think for the coming days. I really do. I have a lot to say and there's so many things that I want to talk about, The things that we don't have confidence in and maybe some things in the Wayback Machine that maybe we do haven't thought of before. So I'd like to bring those to the forefront, if you don't mind. Obviously, we had the Texas mass shooting at the mall in Texas. I have a lot of questions, of course, but I'm actually not going to go into those today. There's a lot of questions: The tattoos that are in the booking, you know the mugshot of the killer and then, not present in the kill, shot on the ground, neck tattoos that I don't know how they would just disappear, things like that. There are so many things like that and honestly I want to talk about it in a more general way because this is something we haven't, actually I've never really brought up. I don't think is the overall plausibility of such an action and I don't think we've been told over the last three or four decades about these things how somebody just wants to go in and shoot up anonymous people they don't know because they're so unhinged, mentally unhinged or uncorked or whatever you want to say. But let's talk about just the overall plausibility. On this show I shared that there were reports done on, let's say, mass school shootings of anonymous people, and in the 1940s there were only eight, In the 1950s there was one, In the 1960s there was six, In the 1970s only 13.. Those events were all targeted events. They were targeting a teacher, they were targeting a student. Somebody they were very, very angry at was going to get the brunt of what they were feeling that day. We'll put it that way, okay. So, completely targeted: Never an anonymous mass shooting of people that people don't know I ran across this comment out there in Internet land and I thought it was very stunning because it really sums this up beautifully. Let's just take a step back because I've gone over all kinds of mass shootings. This actually really, I think, sums up. let's look at how they're taking place and why. These frequent killings of groups of random, innocent people just aren't really possible. They're not possible throughout history. They really don't happen ever. It's very strange. People in the United States, if they're actually going to arrive at a point where they're willing to kill a group of people, are many thousand times more likely to kill a group of people that they feel engaged in injustice against them or people they know or care about. That you can understand. That we can see in history. It wasn't until they started the mass gun control- taking away of the Second Amendment- that we started seeing all these mass shootings. If these random mass killings were legitimate, there would also simultaneously be thousands, a thousand times more killings and bombings of politicians, CEOs, bosses in meetings, malpractice churches, molestation cases, abuse cases, police departments. You would see such an uptick in that to then have to correlate with the random, mass, anonymous shooting that you would see the numbers just through the roof right now: Killings of random people in so-called safe places like schools, movie theaters, restaurants and malls- okay- and churches- They are really non-existent in comparison. You would see one of those for every several thousand of ones that are targeted, But we're not seeing that, are we? And every week we seem to have a new one. The odds of that happening are a trillion to one. They would not in fact be happening because it's not laid out in history. You can say people are unhinged and, oh my gosh, they're mental. or Trantifa, you know Little Miss Nashville shooter, Antifa, Trantifa the trans activist. But you know what? You would see a correlation and we're not seeing it. It's just not there. Think about that. Every single week, an anonymous shooting, a guy goes in for no reason, or a Trantifa goes in for no reason, and all of a sudden you have this major mass shooting for no apparent reason of anonymous people. It doesn't happen, folks. It never happened in history in all the reports I've ever done. It's not possible. You would see a correlation. I'll be right back on the Alex Jones Show.

Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm Kate Dally, your guest host from katedallyradiocom. The only reason that these events would be possible is if the CIA were staging events to scare people into believing that they're not safe anymore and that police expansion and support of military invasions is needed to help keep them safe. And that's exactly what we're seeing, isn't it? The overall plausibility of any event like this happening in the way that we're told just isn't there. You would have to see patterns in history of this. The only patterns we're seeing is in this fraudulent presidency- I can't even call it a presidency- Fraudulent King, Fraud-a-Lot- You're seeing it weekly, because one of the agendas is to take your Second Amendment, your God-give-it Second Amendment. Crazy, right, Think about that, though It just wouldn't happen. But I want to take you back to an event, because this event is very interesting. You know, there's lots of events in history where, in recent history, I have to say, where the only reason we don't, you know, or people are shunned from bringing up the obvious questions- and, by the way, the questions only arise- it seems to be in the events where mass shootings of anonymous people take place. Those are the only ones I really have questions about. Isn't that odd? Those are the only ones where the pictures don't add up, the circumstances don't add up, something's wrong. But what's interesting is the card that's played to get you to not talk about. that is respect for the victims, okay, But we have trials every day in America about going after the truth. for a victim, You would always want the truth, wouldn't you? I would think so, But when it comes to anonymous mass shootings, you're not allowed to look for the truth. It's always about: but we have to respect, but we have to. you can't say anything. you can't say anything. Very strange. Those really truly are the only questions I get right or have or in those types of events, and I've done hours and hours on it, pointing out all the weirdness, all the crazy. So I want to take you back to Waco for a moment, because I wonder if we got that right. On the right, necessarily, we kind of come up with this, but Waco, and yes, we know what the feds did and we know the display and we know a Jan or Reno's involved, and we know all of these things, but do we ever even question Waco? because when I was talking about CIA staged events, how do you know? this isn't one too. Hmm, let's just take a look at a couple of things that don't add up, because I think this is very interesting. According to Dick Morris, Janet Reno made a statement, and the statement was long after Waco and she said: if you don't appoint me, I'm going to tell the truth about Waco. But what exactly was that truth? Because I think a lot of people think the truth was that the feds just went in and annihilated this group. That's normally what I would think. right, I'm going to tell the truth about Waco. We set this up, we went in, wanted to make an example out of them and we did it. okay, But is there more to the story than that? David Koresh's name is actually Vernon Howell and he was well-funded. and that's always a big question mark for me, because when I see somebody well-funded, I always think that's really, really strange. You see somebody like a Warren Jeffs, that evil little piece of action, and Warren Jeffs- the investigation took an awful long time to get to the point where they were actually going to go in and take him down, And he was extremely manipulative, very evil guy, okay, But it took a long time. He was well-funded through his organization, but this wasn't an organization where the money was flowing in. This only had about 70 followers, not exactly the richest people on Earth, okay. So this land, this Mount Carmel Center commune piece of land, was occupied by him and he actually took this land and this was all according to Lieutenant Barber's report that he operated this religious cult commune at Mount Carmel Center And he adopted the name David Koresh a year before. This wasn't like it was really going on with 70 people, I mean up until about just a year before. okay, That property was owned by a different individual who was kind of a cult guy and you guys remember the show I did about the farm, right? The farm, the biggest commune in America's history, well-funded Man. those people had 100 buses, gas money, food money, could buy land And what did they blame it on? They blamed it on, oh well, people had inheritances. Young hippies that are 20 years old suddenly walk into inheritances. Who could afford all of that? I don't think so. It never made any sense And they showcased it on the media from the moment it began. And I talked about this on the show, right? Okay, so you have this religious cult with about 20 people and then David Koresh- Vernon Howell has enough money to travel around and recruit members around the world from different places like Hawaii. He goes and he has the funds to travel and recruit. He couldn't come up with more people in the United States than 20? My gosh, even the farm had like 300. immediately He goes around and he says: you know he has to travel to recruit these members and these members come in. If half the group of the 70 people that were there were all from outside the United States, why wasn't immigration called in? Strange thing, Immigration wasn't even involved. They didn't even care. Wouldn't you want to see people's passports? Wouldn't you want to know who these people are? One would think. Anyway, that's just a side note. They get this property and the taxes, the back taxes were owed since 1968. That's a whole lot of taxes. but the state never took the property. Why is that? Very strange. So he goes in in a gun battle where charges, a gun battle with various people to get this land and no charges ever came. the acquittal of charges, I should say, came about because of this. Nobody ever fried for any kind of gun battle or actually went to trial and actually ended up with any convictions and it was a gun battle. That's kind of interesting. He was able to take over this property and have it for his so-called followers. The feds followed him around to gun shows, knew that he was getting all of these shipments in called mag bags and they knew exactly what were in these shipments- shipments from Idaho, shipments from gun places, ammunition, all kinds of things. So they absolutely knew. but he wasn't dangerous enough to arrest, only dangerous enough to follow and start making a case over this. The whistleblower was a Branch Davidian. He didn't call the local police, He called the BATF Bureau of Alcohol and Firearms. Why is that? What a strange phone call to make. You want to alert about somebody with only 70 followers not really doing much, but you want to call the BATF Strange And you also want to get the BATF of Little Rock, Arkansas, involved. Remember Clinton was over Waco. Strange, really strange. Why them? Then there was the outside report by an anonymous person outside the state Two Joyce Sparks Texas Department of Human Services in Waco received a complaint, okay, that David Koresh was abusing young kids. But when they went in they didn't exactly do the report on this. They weren't even curious about it And David Koresh just went down and showed them the bunker of all the guns included in the report. But they didn't really interview anyone about the sexual abuse claims. That's kind of strange. In Normalville you would actually do that, You would actually make that part of your report. Something in there would be very interesting to read about whether or not you assess that that is happening or not happening. But the report ended up really being about the firearms- teaching kids about firearms- right, Because they said that they were trained to use these firearms in a bus, down in the bunker below the Mount Carmel commune. But that was kind of strange. And if you really did feel like you needed to have this report, why wouldn't you go a little farther and ask about these things? That was strange too. You would in fact take somebody down that you thought was dangerous, right before it ever got to the point where you would land on their property with all cameras visible for an event in front of the whole world, Certainly with the shipments. if you really thought somebody was dangerous and abusing people, you would take them down far before. But this event was a big event. Was it a staged event? I don't know. Was it a staged event to then criminalize militias and start on the road to developing Homeland Security? That is a really interesting question, isn't it? Because that's what came later. In fact, there were articles written about this very thing, And they said the modern-day militia movement owes its existence to Waco. No, modern-day militia movements are not exactly modern-day. They've been around for a long time, Just more on the down-low. But they wanted this to come out and they wanted to do a lot of press on modern-day militia movements for a reason right. We have the right to militia movements in this country, And I shouldn't even say movement, just militias. They wanted to demonize it. Interesting. I'll be back. I have a little more on this And some other questions I have too, And I'll see you right back on The Alex Jones Show. I'm Kate Dally, your guest host from Kate Dally Radio.

Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. it's Alex Jones, Back here with you on the Alex Jones Show. I'm Kate Dally from katedallyradiocom, So glad to be with you. I'm bringing up a lot of questions. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I'm wrong about some things, I don't know. There certainly are too many questions to ask, though It is very interesting when we get to anonymous mass anything or the staged events of history, possibly, that you're not allowed to ask any questions when obvious questions come up out of respect for the victims. But if you're a single victim of a crime, then you can go to court, and then it's only justice, that where the truth can prevail and you can finally find out what happened to your loved one in court. But if you're in another type of accident- you know, not accident, but a shooting- it's not possible to ask questions. I always find that a little weird, don't you? So let me talk about Waco for just another moment, because I think maybe if we could shift some perspective to see this in a different light- and I know that this might infuriate people, right? That's okay, It's okay to think, it's okay to think So. they didn't see him as a danger but they wanted to just watch him for a very short period of time. You know, when they went in to get Warren Jeffs, that took years in the making, years in the making to finally realize what was going on in his religious group. okay, And this was very quick in a year. Very strange that you would have this happen that quickly. Very strange that you would have a whistleblower from the Branch Davidians. Was this a Fed? One might think so, One might ask that question. Whistleblow right directly to the BATF- strange. I was Little Rock involved. I don't know. did Clinton have something to do with that? They owe him something. Why were his bodyguards involved in BATF agents? right, It doesn't make any sense that they were on site And there was a fire and nobody. there were no autopsies. People were burned up. The one guy that was killed- that was a Branch Davidian- was quickly cremated. family not allowed to see the body. That's kind of strange. That doesn't happen, really Just doesn't happen. The plausibility of all of it, very, very strange. So then there's no autopsies. okay, No way to really go after the truth in that. So that's kind of different. And it was broadcast, they wanted to make sure that everyone saw what was going down. Now we all know what the Feds can do. We're all really aware of how the Feds can demonize and their role in trapping most of their jobs seems to be kind of an entrapment arm now. And so- and I say that because they were found to have the most child porn sites on the dark web right owned by them, monitored by them- to entrap, okay, I get, when people do things wrong, who doesn't want to see somebody? you know the child porn guys go to prison forever or castrated or whatever. But it is strange that the entrapping thing is a big deal. But this was pretty obvious because the Feds went in and were basically annihilating the people in Waco. But why would they want to show you that? Was that the truth Janet Reno was talking about? Possibly, Possibly, Who knows? But that was really strange. It was the beginning of really establishing the Department of Homeland Security. that would come in 2003.. The fake need for this agency to exist with no authority to really exist. in America There is really no authority for Department of Homeland Security federally. okay, Every state can take care of their piece of the land, So no reason for them to exist, But between this and Oklahoma. by the way, Timothy McVeigh was on site right for Waco. He was on site Not part of the Waco, I mean not part of the Branch Davidians, but on the other side right. Very strange, And we all know Oklahoma. There's too many questions about Oklahoma, But here's the deal, though. This article that came out in Mainstream said one Department of Homeland Security official put: the modern day militia movement owes its existence to Waco. That's really strange. The Davidians, I guess, hung a bed sheet from the window that said Rodney King. we understand They were into political messages too. Really, Does that seem a little strange to you? I don't know, It just seemed strange to me. Very strange, actually, A little too strange. right, The probability of this. you know, how many times have you seen a religious commune of about 100 wackadoodle religious people hanging out together? that are really really weird. that also happened to be a militia group. I don't remember the last time I drove by and saw that. Do you? I mean, if Waco, if this was happening more and more and they had to develop a Department of Homeland Security, not only for 9-11, and let's not even go there- but also because of Waco, wouldn't you see these groups pop up all the time? Wouldn't this be something that you would see, like the plausibility of these action groups? Warren Jeff's group wasn't even a militia group, just a religious group, a religious weird group, right, Okay, Under his control. So I found that to be a little strange. The Bureau of Alcohol Firearms, Tobacco Firearms and Explosives was founded in the late 1800s and it was a branch of the Treasury Department, But after this Waco event they moved in under the Department of Justice. Why? That was weird, because it was under the Homeland Security Act. Very strange, Okay, There's too many weird things. Undercover agents galore. They had over 500 agents. some say 800 agents on site. That's a little weird too. Why so many? Why would you need that many people for such a tiny group Makes no sense. Some people will argue: well, it was training exercise, right, Who knows? But that seems like a huge amount. They wanted the presence to be known, They wanted this event to be known And they wanted you to think militia groups were on the rise and that they were dangerous. of course, which we know- that people in militias are actually really mostly good, patriotic people that care about their country, that know and can read. obviously the Second Amendment and the founders as to why they wanted to make sure that the people could defend themselves against what- Not just somebody coming in to hurt them, but their government. right, So everyone can understand that, Okay, The land was just taken over. cremations, no bodies observed, bogus investigations, well-funded. One of the things that's really, I think, something very interesting to key in on is how these things are funded, because they don't make sense. They don't make sense. Warren Jeffs had a bunch of people who were contributing with their jobs in the outside community to help with the money, so that you could see, But on this, there was never an explanation as to far as where the money came from to buy the land, to take this over, to do all these things Seems a little more orchestrated for the entire event, does it not? I think that these things, when you don't have the plausibility level and, like I stated before, if you have somebody going in and shooting up anonymous people for no reason, I'm sorry, but you can't just say bad mental health- That doesn't work because it doesn't go along with the nature of man. When you go back into history and you look at all the mass school shootings- and really they weren't mass right, Because in history they were always targeted. It was for one person only or outside the school boundaries, one entity, and that was included in those numbers. It was very, very rare. and you can't even blame video games at this point. Video games doesn't make you get up and shoot a bunch of anonymous people because it doesn't happen. People used to bring guns to school for Pete's sakes. We had target practice utilizing weaponry at school and you didn't have those kinds of things happen. But I don't blame mental illness in video games. I think these things are more staged and I think it's convenient to blame mental illness in video games for these things. I do. I think it's very convenient because you can blame the culture. but still going up and shooting up anonymous people isn't as plausible as you think it is and really there should be much more events have been targeted. if that's the case, I'll be right back. I have more, more questions, of course, on the Alex Jones Show. Shouldn't we be-? I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had. I don't think anybody can deny it, and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us. When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers. they really have been the MVPs in this fight, and when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day- five, six, seven days a week- it's really just incredible. So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support. I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us. I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us and that's wonderful. keep doing it. but most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStorecom and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life while at the same time keeping us on air.

Take action now. but regardless. research is info Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. it's Alex Jones. Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm Kate Dally, your guest host from katedallyradiocom, The Kate Dally Show. I'm so glad to be here with you because, look, you can always ask questions. right, Questions never hurt anybody And I always want to see things from different vantage points. I like the challenge- personally I really do- because it makes me think And our narratives are so strong that sometimes we pick and choose which narratives we want to look at And sometimes I think maybe that does a disservice to us. Maybe we ought to look at everything, question everything and then see what sticks right And then see what has the plausibility factor big time. There was a huge event right last week about Russia threatening nuclear revenge And in December we heard he was readying the nukes. I mean not just looking at nukes, but readying the nukes. you know, to come after us And a lot of people thought, within a couple of days, everything was going to be nuked. And I said no. I said they love this threat. This threat is. it grabs headlines, there's fear, the boogeyman, you know- And they've been doing this for 80 years- okay, 70 years, And so what was interesting about it, though, was I had just read a piece questioning the Trinity. Trinity: was the nuclear weapon test right for the Manhattan Project before the detonation of the bomb? Well, Japan had already surrendered. There was never really a reason to drop that bomb. So why did they? In fact, they surrendered twice, I do believe. okay, So there was never a reason for it. So why did they do it? That's an interesting question, because there had to have been a much bigger reason to drop a bomb. when somebody already surrenders, And they're using this over and over again. I could go back to 1980. headlines right now that would tell you the exact same thing: Oh, the nukes are readying, we're about to get nuked. Everything was about nuclear warfare, and it always has been right. That's why we made North Korea the enemy. We'd put them on the stage. I can just picture like a clown dancing on stage. you know, when you bring out the next enemy. you say they're going to nuke us. We could take out North Korea in two seconds. I mean it was ridiculous, but people believed it right. So this was kind of interesting. We have this new movie Oppenheimer, coming out, And whenever I see a movie that is sort of highlighting, if you will, the narratives of our time- and they love to do this, okay- you'll always see the movies backing it up. right, You'll always see a dramatic movie to get the emotion behind it on the Manhattan Project and the atomic bomb, And so when I see a movie I'm always a little intrigued to go look at the events from another perspective to see maybe what we were lied about, what they lied to us about, okay, Trinity, and maybe they didn't. I just want to bring this up because I think it's worthy of a question. Trinity was the code name for the first detonation of the nuclear weapon And it was conducted by the United States Army as part of the Manhattan Project. July 16th, over the summer in 1945, in New Mexico, Socorro, New Mexico. It's now part of the White Sands Missile Range And the only structures originally in the vicinity were the McDonald Ranch House and some buildings which the scientists used as a laboratory for testing bombs And the base camp was constructed and there were about 425 people present on the weekend of the test And the code name Trinity was assigned to Oppenheimer. but really, the guy really behind all of this that's never truly mentioned was Vannevar Bush. He was a guy that was in policy, He had the presidency or he had a ton of power. Remember Valerie from Iran that had all the power in Obama's regime. Okay, So the little whisper, the ear whisper. okay, This was the same kind of thing. Vannevar Bush was this guy at this time and he was the one that orchestrated the whole Manhattan Project and Oppenheimer to do this, But oddly enough, the movie's about Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer, however you want to say it, You know I'm the name murderer, so whatever, Anyway, get over it. So the test was an implosion design plutonium device named the Gadget, and the same design as the Fat Man bomb, later detonated over Japan. And then, of course, the complexity of the design. This was going to be the first nuclear test ever. okay, It was directed by Kenneth Bainbridge, Also in this same thing. right, they said the rise of the fascist governments in Europe led to a fear of the German nuclear weapon project, especially among scientists who were refugees of Nazi Germany and other countries and so forth, And so this was the reason they put out in order to get the funding and the okay to do all of this. okay, So Julian Mack and Berlin Brixner were responsible for photography. The photography group employed some 50 different cameras taking motion and still photographs. okay, They had special Fastax cameras. Now we all know that many companies- I'll say this lightly- many companies that dealt with cameras and such were CIA ops, but I just want to throw that out there because we know this now. okay, So they were taking these photographs, but wouldn't you know that only one photograph actually came into fruition? only one far away photograph by one obscure person named Jack Aby actually got a picture of it. And did you know- and it's kind of blurry and it's off, but did you know this- That the only picture that was ever taken that was actually well exposed? they had all these cameras, they knew what they were blowing up, right, but then they couldn't get a good shot of it. but just the one guy had one picture. They wanted his negative. They handed the negative over and the negative doesn't even exist today. It's kind of like the moon with NASA: Not one single document about how we got there or what we were doing ever showed up again and was lost. because somebody lost the key, or I don't know what happened to the storage unit somewhere off somewhere, Washington DC, that it was stored- who knows Maryland. Anyway, the only negative of this photo was lost Man, the only negative of the nuclear test that would set off the nuclear program was lost. Gosh, so weird, strange, Anyway, all right. so here's the question, and this was written by Russ Winter just lately, and I love this, so hat tip to him: Was Hiroshima firebombed and not nuked at the time? This is a really, really good question, because I want to read to you the testimony of US Major Alexander Seversky, who died in 1945,, coincidentally, died right after this, right after he said this- inspected the bombed towns of Japan, and this is what he said: In Hiroshima. I was prepared for radically different sites, but to my surprise, Hiroshima looked exactly like all the other burned out cities in Japan. There was a familiar pink blot about two miles in diameter. It was dotted with charred trees and telephone poles and one of the only city's 20 bridges was down. Only one of the bridges was only one of the city's bridges was down. it's weird. Usually it just decimates everything, doesn't it? So we were told. anyway, Hiroshima's clusters of modern buildings in the downtown section stood upright, he said It was obvious that the blast could not have been so powerful as we'd been led to believe. It was an extensive blast rather than intensive. Think about that: it was an extensive blast rather than an intensive blast. I had heard buildings constantly consumed by unprecedented heat. yet there I saw buildings structurally intact and, what is more, topped by undamaged flagpoles, lightning rods, painted railings, air raid precaution signs and fragile objects that were just standing there. They weren't decimated. At the T-bridge, he said, the aiming point for the atomic bomb, I looked for the bald spot where everyone presumably had been vaporizing the twinkling of an eye, but it wasn't there, or anywhere else. I could find no traces of unusual phenomena. strange, What did I see in substance? a replica, or the Tokyo suburbs, Yokohama or Osaka, the familiar residue of an area of wood and brick houses raised by uncontrollable fire, he said. Everywhere I saw the trunks of charred and leafless trees burned and unburned chunks of wood. the fire had been intense enough to bend and twist steel grinders, yet to melt glass until it ran like lava, just as in other Japanese cities, he had seen where they were firebombed. The concrete buildings nearest to the center of explosion, only a few blocks from the heart of the atom blast, showed no structural damage. Even cornices, canopies, delicate exterior decorations were intact. Window glass was shattered, But of course the single panel frames held firm. only window frames and two or more panels were bent and buckled, And the blast impact therefore could not have been unusual. And this event was not unusual. but he expected to see it, just didn't see it. And oddly enough, the victims were flown over here right away for care in our army hospitals. Strange, right. I thought that US Major Alexander, I should say D Seversky, I thought his words were interesting, don't you? Anybody that was there that saw it, that had these thoughts? very, very strange. Something to look at, something to keep in mind. Think about narratives. Hmm, I'll be right back on the Alex Jones Show. I'm Kate Daly, your guest host. Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution, is laying right there in front of you, hidden in plain view. Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds. If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website where they admit the number one cause of cognitive disability in the world is iodine deficiency. The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability is lack of real, pure iodine in the body as they bomb us with the bad halogens, bromine, bromide, chlorine and so much more. Upwards of 2 billion people in a Lancet Medical Journal study in 2007, worldwide have cognitive disabilities because they don't have high quality iodine.

Back here with you on the Alex Jones Show. I'm Kate Dally from katedallyradiocom. Good to be with you. As we sum this up, I want to bring up just some points I've been thinking about. okay, We know that these people are full of narratives, okay, And I'm sure that we have weapons of destruction. There's no doubt in my mind. What do you think they've been working on? and have black budgets, for Many black budgets we know nothing about. that's why they're called black. And obviously we know DARPA. all the agencies have been really hard at work at developing things. But sometimes I wonder if, maybe, just maybe- and I know this is very controversial, so whatever, get over it, just think about it for just a moment. What if the nukes are disinformation to the things that they actually have, Things that maybe they could blame on something else in the future, Maybe even aliens, who knows? Because that seems to be the card they want to play And the stuff that they've come up with. they'll blame it on aliens so that we can't counter it right, So we don't have any action against it, so we can't do anything about it. So I have to wonder, because- let me give you a couple more points of interest on this, because I know how controversial this is going to be. I know that brains might be exploding right now- because we don't really question this, do we? Okay? So let's start history of the Second World War. They claimed that the Japanese on the ground didn't even know they'd been A-bombed till long after the war. How would you not know? Allied occupation authorities also clamped down on eyewitness testimonies. Testimonies that did come out often had a scripted, deceptive quality to them. I'm thinking 9-11, too. Same kind of thing, right, The accounts themselves have been describing a napalm bombing, but then suggestive phrases are inserted into the narratives, like strange yellow ray and sun ray. There are also- and it is kind of strange to have multiple people describe it in that way- right, There are also accounts of a single B-29 flying over, and flying over at 32,000 feet, and the bomber would not be visible from the ground, nor would a small fleet. okay, But, however, there was a father, a clerical, a father who provided, and John Seames, who provided more information to how this went down, because he said it was rumored that the enemy flyers had spread an explosive and incendiary material over the city and then created an explosion and ignition. And a few maintain that they saw the planes drop a parachute which had carried something that exploded at a height of 1,000 meters, and no one knew anything for certain concerning the nature of the bomb. Well, that's kind of strange and I don't know that. the father would lie about that. He said that was the rumor. And the bombing planners, drawing from their science of mass killing, first spread incendiary material to prep the target, this soaked kindling that could have been lit like a match from a small high-flying fleet of B-29s. This makes it possible to destruct the target with even less than 66 aircraft and would make it highly contained and highly controllable. And then, of course, the absence- remember the cameras I mentioned at the test, the Trinity test- the absence of the mushroom cloud photos from the ground in Japan among the very few photos of the Hiroshima bombing that do exist. and, by the way, why aren't there more photos of it? If you're going to drop an A-bomb, you're not going to have any pictures, Just a couple. Does that seem strange to anybody? Look at how many cameras they had set up for the test. that didn't exactly work out, but still they had a lot of cameras there, did they not? You wouldn't want to photograph this for all the world to see? Hmm, because it did become the big nuke program. and then that has been used as the boogeyman ever since. Strange, I have to call strange on that. And of course, the following three suggest a raging firestorm, not a nuclear explosion. The photos appear consistent with the others, shot at different distances and angles, And the firestorms which were described at Hamburg in 1943, Dresden in 1945, and other various Japanese incinerations of 1945 look oddly similar. Was it an A-bomb or a firestorm? In the book Osada's Children of the A-bomb, a survivor described a scene that is altogether different from the A-bomb, saying: I looked up in the sky streamer of smoke, perhaps 50 yards high, rising from the center of Hiroshima about two miles distant, And at the top of the column of smoke was a ball of fire which seemed to be about the size of a large oil tank. Huh, Hmm, Anyway. so I bring you this just to think about this, because when the people were brought over here for medical care, that was strange. They said that the radiation exposure did not cause genetic damage, which it would have, one would think. A 40-year study of thousands of Japanese who survived the so-called atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima right, And there was an intense study of 70,000 offspring of the atomic bomb survivors that failed to identify an increase in congenital abnormalities or cancer or mutational blood protein changes or anything. And that was a 1990 study in the Journal of American Medical Association- Strange, really strange, And I think strange enough to ask more questions about it. And maybe, I don't know, there's just something that's kind of wrong with, I think, the information that we get, And so it's worthy of a look, one would think. The other thing I want to end on is something more recent And I want to talk about public health for just a moment. Public health is a really interesting thing because in a free society you don't need public health. The individual within a state just goes for their medical help, am I right? You go in to see your doctor. What do you mean? public health? It's a very, very strange thing. It was a creation, a Rockefeller creation, and the organization started in really the late 1800s. but early 1900s is really when they put themselves on the map based on a lie. They had to, because how do you construct public health when it's not necessary? So they said they solved or ended hookworm. Hookworm was like 400,000 people in the entire United States. Down in the South hookworm was already being cured, because the only cure was: put some shoes on. Anyway, that's easy. So what they did was they became an entity worthy of money being given to it by the Rockefellers became a government entity that took some of the duties away from the country doctor at the time, And at the time they wanted to be in charge of prevention. That was what the doctors were in charge of. They wanted to be in charge of all these things, And so, when you think about it, we are a country of individuals that can seek out health issues individually, not in a collective manner, And public health was there to basically push shots for pharma. That's really their whole role. If there's a problem, they have a shot to solve it, Do they not? That's really what they're about, And so what's interesting about this? this is exactly why they were created, for sure, But they were put out as the centrally organized arm of the federal government. that was basically the control mechanism. So in the emergency orders of late, you had this: public health. everything was blamed on the public health. The schools blamed public health, the signs on the store windows about wearing a mask, and all of this all blamed on public health. There's public health officials now that run public health departments that are coming out and going. well, yeah, I mean, it was a minor respiratory, sorry, but no real accountability. They had website ticker clocks for the amount of so-called deaths, or I love this one- the projected death toll always right And the deaths they knew at the time. on these death tolls on the websites of all the public health agencies in the country, of the counties and the states were all giving the same ticker clocks and the same information, And I mean verbatim, from the CDC. the CDC was allowed to control every single one of those health departments and nobody in the health department spoke up. Nobody in the health departments contradicted the information, Only a few. I had a guy that was local that kind of said a few things locally, I don't know, but still it was shored up by public health. They even put in their own brand of CIA agents that actually work in public health and ousted the longstanding. this is what happened in my state: ousted the longstanding public health state guy and put this new fresh CIA agent in as public health administrator, right, And so you had the CDC working through all the states. The reason I say this is because why isn't there any accountability? They were in charge of shutting down the nation, truly, because everybody blamed them And they didn't exactly say they had questions. They didn't say well, you should think about this first, or maybe, maybe not, or geez, it looks like a cold or flu or whatever. They went along with the lie, not only went along, but advertised the lie And then, of course, would show up and talk about the big danger. Did it make them feel important? Is that why they did it? Did it make them feel like they had the world stage? The only way we're going to solve the next time they get away with doing this, or they try to, is to fight this in every single county in America. Start to make them have the accountability for what they lied about, what they did when they knew they didn't have any proof, because they all know that car accidents and cancer and Alzheimer's were all chalked up as COVID deaths And they did nothing to tell you the truth. And if you go county by county, public health department by public health department, and people actually sued their public health departments, Can you even imagine what would happen? Can you even imagine the fact that we could take down their very structural, centrally organized organization? Because that's how they did it last time. everything, even the government, relied on public health to shore them up. Public health was an entity that never should have been and the whole thing was founded on a lie for organization. I'm Kate Daly for the Alex Jones Show. Thanks for thinking with me today. Thanks for this hour. I really appreciate you guys tuning in. Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire food supply. Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element, which has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population, And there are two things we need to do about it. We need to practice more regenerative farming. There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally keep the soil rich with iodine- and we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day.

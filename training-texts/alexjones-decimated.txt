Target becomes the latest target of anti-woke boycott as it sells satanist, pride, LGBTQ plus products for kids. Folks, this is getting out of control. It's not just putting girls' clothes in the boys' aisle. It's not just putting, like an, I'm gay with a rainbow flag shirt in the boys' aisle. It's going to dark, sordid places. you can't even imagine Target under fire for selling clothing made by creepy, satanic transgender designer that promotes drugs and violence. Yes, folks, that's how bad it's gotten. They do studies where kids end up killing themselves. Now there's multiple threads on this currently on Twitter, If you want to find them. Scarlett Johnson has one, Aristos Revenge has one, And you can see. And they're running entrapment schemes against you And they're censoring you and imprisoning you. Ah yes, and you know the final stage of this. So here it is. Tell me, does this woman belong in the Nebraska State Senate or does she belong in a mental institution?

You matter. You belong here, Mental institution or Nebraska State Senate? Where does Michaela Cavan all belong? Now? let's put aside our own politics here for a second and think about this as an issue. If you really believe that there's some sort of discrimination or hatred or bigotry against trans people, and you really believe that, okay, okay, but where does that rank on the issues that we're facing in this country? How many people are affected by transphobia? You'd be tough to find one, wouldn't you? How many people are affected by our gas prices going up, our energy prices going up, the grocery bill going up, property taxes going up? Oh well, gee, that's just about everybody, isn't it? If you really believe that there's some sort of discrimination or hatred or bigotry against trans people, and you really believe that, okay, okay, but where does that rank on the issues that we're facing in this country? How many people are affected by transphobia? You'd be tough to find one, wouldn't you? How many people are affected by our gas prices going up, our energy prices going up, the grocery bill going up, property taxes going up? Oh well, gee, that's just about everybody, isn't it? But no, they want to get up there and rant about trans people because they think it's some sort of a virtue signal cause. Even if you do believe that's a big issue, it's like not even in the top thousand issues this country is facing. But you know, I think about this. I think about this because we actually have a growing trans and gay population here in Austin. I'm not saying that these things coincide with one another, but you know, Austin, when I moved here for multiple years straight, was the number one city to move to and live in. I think about this because we actually have a growing trans and gay population here in Austin. I'm not saying that these things coincide with one another, but you know, Austin, when I moved here for multiple years straight, was the number one city to move to and live in. We're now at number 40.. I'm not saying that has something to do with the trans community moving in here or the gay community moving in here. I just think it's more about just the left-wing ideology taking over. the Democrat Party taking over is what takes it from number one to number 40 in less than five years, And you know, seeing trans people everywhere or having a new blossoming gay strip downtown is just kind of a sign of that. Now I'm not really bothered by it. I like having fun. I've got a bit of a degenerate side to me. I like to drink too much- probably Not as much anymore, but when I was younger- And so I don't care. that's totally not true. And then they share it out to the trans community here as an effort to put a target on my back. And so now should I be concerned if I go out and I'm having somebody that's behind the counter or in the kitchen making my meal that might be a trans person? I mean, it's already going on with leftists and liberals. But see, the issue here gets conflated. I'm not against trans people, I'm not against cross-dressers, I'm not against drag queens. I'm against propagandizing children into mutilating their bodies. That's what I'm against. I'm against propagandizing children and grooming them sexually. That's my issue. I'm not against trans people, I'm not against cross-dressers, I'm not against drag queens. I'm against propagandizing children into mutilating their bodies. That's what I'm against. I'm against propagandizing children and grooming them sexually. That's my issue. But see, they conflate it and they take it out of context and they say: you hate trans people, you're against trans. No, leave the kids alone. Again back to the story. Why have you had a 1,300% increase in children searching: am I gay, am I trans? You have confused an entire generation of children. Farage, on Twitter, posted this. He said: what if there was an advert saying blacks need not apply? There'd be massive outrage. And again, despite the fact that white British people are indeed a minority- majority minority, at least in these big UK cities- they are still being discriminated against. And it's all legal, It's all lawful, as I just said, under the 2010 Equalities Act. Now I'm going to get into the latest transgender propaganda news and all the fun and goodies that the alphabet people are bringing us. But first let's touch on a bit of good news, because I've got this clip, which some of you will have seen, some of you won't have seen, of Elon Musk talking to an NBC journalist, And it ties into this article. Poll shows how radically different Americans' opinions are from liberal corporate media narratives. Again, we have this wall of the censorship industrial complex. We have the wall of fact checkers, legacy media outlets trying to push one narrative, trying to monster vilify anyone who disagrees with that narrative and trying to portray them as a tiny extremist minority fringe, Turns out that's complete BS. Other products feature skeletons draped in pride and trans colors, gay cult stuff. Again, it literally says: we're part of a gay cult And this is what Target has chosen to endorse and sell in its stores. Again, Target- the same company that is busy pulling some of its stores out of major cities because they keep being looted over and over again- now choosing to go down the Bud Light Dylan Avery route and risking another potential massive, successful boycott. So good luck with that. Meanwhile- this came out last week and most people didn't even see it- Transgender mass shooter also targeted Cathedral. During a killing spree, transgender mass shooter Audrey Hale also targeted a neo-Gothic cathedral attached to the Covenant school. This came out as a result of an article written by a family member of one of the victims, who revealed this detail, which hadn't so far been revealed in news. media reports that the killer targeted a cathedral, shot out some stained glass windows, And then it was reported again last week that this manifesto, of course whenever there's a manifesto online from a white shooter, or indeed an obscure profile on a Russian social media website- that fits in with the exact narrative that the regime wants to push. that was very convenient, wasn't it last week? Well, it's released within 24 hours. October 19, 2021. transmission that the power structure is working as hard as it can to shut down. Okay, let me tell you what we got coming up for you today. I was on Stephen Crowder's show a few weeks ago in Dallas. Love the show. Super funny, super talented, super smart crew And, of course, their main star, Stephen Crowder, who is a shining star of Liberty And they've told him a lot that if he criticizes, the anointed protected group amongst all the protected groups is the trans male, the males that give up their masculinism to become female. they believe- And I don't hate people that want to do that or say that I do hate them trying to be the center of attention and take over my life and go into women's bathrooms and show their penises to people, because there is that group of them doing that- that the media is defending And also raping women inside, you know, bathroom stalls And the press even covers for that, as you know. Well, he's been told: don't you dare talk about it anymore. When you know men go to prison saying they're a woman, they go: oh, you're a woman, Oh, we'll just put you in a prison so you can rape and impregnate women. He dared criticize that. So they gave him another strike and one more. Yep, Quarter, Black Garrett, Awesome. Okay, Are we ready, though? I don't know that I'm ever ready. I don't know that we want to be ready. But the Women's Liberation Front- I already hate this. The worst Reported: at least one woman at the Central California Women's Facility was pregnant after a male, transgender male prisoner was transferred there. Keep in mind: the male prisoner was permitted to transfer under the new California law, SB 132,, which allows biological males. We're not supposed to use the term biological males now. We're supposed to use a person with penis or something. Yes, No, it's something else. I don't know that we want to be ready. But the Women's Liberation Front- I already hate this.

We're supposed to use a person with penis or something. Yes, No, it's something else. male Lady MacBulls- Yes, Seeding person. Yes, Seeding person. Is that what I said? Look, I don't even need to finish the premise, and it's very clearly meant to be a joke. Not only that, Alex, you were here. You know that on that show, the whole joke was we were tiptoeing around the fact that we couldn't even acknowledge the differences between biological men, who identifies women versus women, And that's the premise for an immaculate conception. So the whole joke is a not joke that we can't actually make the joke. And the interesting thing, Alex, is I don't know if you guys have the overlays from this, but the lawyer from YouTube- and I said this yesterday I find some solace in the fact that they're very expensive hourly attorney- sent a letter specifying what infraction we committed And coincidentally it happened to go up immediately, just hours after we did an entire show on the Loudoun County situation. you know the transgender, the boy- sorry, the bisexual boy in a skirt who raped multiple girls in Loudoun County. We got the notification, or, sorry, the letter, from the lawyer immediately afterward, But in there they said: you cannot, and of course, insert here: incite violence, commit hate speech. But then it said: or indicate that transgender individuals may pose a rape threat to women. That language encompasses everything on the topic of bathroom bills, That language just to be clear. what's so concerning to me is there were 100 parents right at Loudoun County who were protesting the school board because this young girl was raped by a bisexual boy in a skirt, I don't really know what gender they consider.

But parents wanted to protest in general saying: well, we are opposed to this. That language encompasses everything on the topic of bathroom bills, That language just to be clear. what's so concerning to me is there were 100 parents right at Loudoun County who were protesting the school board because this young girl was raped by a bisexual boy in a skirt, I don't really know what gender they consider. that That's how it was reported. But parents wanted to protest in general saying: well, we are opposed to this. Why are you opposed to this? Parents at a town hall, parents at a PTA meeting, we think that letting biological boys or girls with penises, as you guys call, we think that letting them into the girls' rooms could be a potential rape risk? Boom, banned. You can say it in the real town square, but you can't say it in the digital one. And that is unprecedented what we're experiencing here. Well, I mean, actually the father went to protest about the reported rape of his daughter by the man in the skirt and they did arrest him, They did put him in handcuffs And so really, this is out of control. And that is unprecedented what we're experiencing here. Well, I mean, actually the father went to protest about the reported rape of his daughter by the man in the skirt and they did arrest him, They did put him in handcuffs And so really, this is out of control. And then we learned he'd been transferred to another school where another rape reportedly happened, And then Yahoo News tried to say it didn't exist but later had to admit: okay, there are two police reports, there have been a arrest, And so, just like the guy out at the spa in LA, the Asian spa, who went into the hot tub with the grandma, the mother and the nine-year-old girl and, you know, talked about sex, turned out he was a convicted sex offender. And to be clear. I want to be really clear about something here. I have never, ever said that all transgender people are rapists. I've never even said, and wouldn't say, that most transgender people are racist. Why? Because I don't believe it. Now I think some are, and I think some even heterosexual males who are predators will use it as a guise to commit acts of sexual assault.

Now I think some are, and I think some even heterosexual males who are predators will use it as a guise to commit acts of sexual assault. I don't care how someone actually identifies. and then you go to the school board and say, okay, what about this? They said that never happened. That's the issue that we're talking about. When you talk about the California state prison system, you say, okay, what about these pregnancies? Well, that never happened. We don't have evidence that it was from a transgender individual. We just know a woman got pregnant in prison. Oh, okay, All right. Well, I thought we were following the science. So my mistake. Also, a lot of pedophiles like to dress up as women to trick children into their white raper vans. I mean, this has all come out. So there's this leftist Hollywood fetish with men dressing up like women, coming after women and children, And there is a certain percentage of predators that want to be able to hide in restrooms and, when women come in, rape them, and it's happening all over the world, And so the fact that that's happening is real and the left is trying to cover it up. Well, let's also be clear about something with the rules, There are also plenty of men who dress up like women, who don't identify as women. I mean, think of Hoover, right, There are plenty of men who have done this in the past. And the issue here now is it's kind of difficult to tell honestly for someone, a layman, to go: OK, this person is simply a man who just like a cross-dresser, but this person is transgender. This person is transsexual. because most transgender individuals don't go through with the bottom surgery. A lot of them don't go through with the top surgery. They simply dress and identify as women, But it would be considered grossly offensive to imply that they are a cross-dresser or transvestite, which at one point was just sort of something that people did. I mean, this has all come out.

So the issue here is really it's the elimination of gender lines, the elimination of this idea that men and women are fundamentally different, The idea that children do best, ideally, in a household with a mother and a father.

And I want to be clear about this too. I think, look, when you're talking about a group of transgender individuals who have a 40-plus attempted suicide rate between 41 and 42, and then it's about the same thing post-op- I do think that there needs to be compassion for these groups of people, Absolutely, Because no other group has an attempted suicide rate. American slaves didn't have a 41 to 42-percent attempted suicide rate, which tells me again. because most transgender individuals don't go through with the bottom surgery.

American slaves didn't have a 41 to 42-percent attempted suicide rate, which tells me again. I think some transgender individuals are treated horribly- and I would never do that- But they're not, as a whole, treated worse than American slaves, which may suggest there's something internally that we can help with. Absolutely. Stay right there.

Absolutely. Stay right there. Steven Crowder is trying to help people. so am I. I'm not enemies with men that are confused, but there are predators posing as women and the left is defending it. So there are feminists now who are reaching out and saying: you know what? I disagree with a lot of the things that you've said in the past, but I, I understand it. Look, you know, this is something that I. what I think is important for people to note is it's- I'm sorry, it's the fault of suburban white women. I blame you. People don't understand this. When you talk about transgender individuals in sports, for example, okay, biological men going into women's sports, most women support it. Most men oppose it. Time and time again, even though we don't have a dog in the fight. Now, the reason we oppose it is not because we hate transgender individuals. It's for the same reason that we don't want to see men beating up on women. I blame you. People don't understand this. When you talk about transgender individuals in sports, for example, okay, biological men going into women's sports, most women support it. Most men oppose it. Time and time again, even though we don't have a dog in the fight. Now, the reason we oppose it is not because we hate transgender individuals. It's for the same reason that we don't want to see men beating up on women. It's quite that simple. So, look, let's just look at it this way. Let's remove the label when we're talking about the bathroom situation of transgender, whatever it is, it's just okay. Time and time again, even though we don't have a dog in the fight. Now, the reason we oppose it is not because we hate transgender individuals. It's for the same reason that we don't want to see men beating up on women. It's quite that simple. So, look, let's just look at it this way. Let's remove the label when we're talking about the bathroom situation of transgender, whatever it is, it's just okay. let's say: I'm a sexual predator, right, and I'm attracted to women. Let's just assume that for a second. And I could be a straight white male, or I could be a male to female, transgender, lesbian, slash. your guess is as good as mine. It's quite that simple. So, look, let's just look at it this way. Let's remove the label when we're talking about the bathroom situation of transgender, whatever it is, it's just okay. let's say: I'm a sexual predator, right, and I'm attracted to women. Let's just assume that for a second. And I could be a straight white male, or I could be a male to female, transgender, lesbian, slash. your guess is as good as mine. Let's just not get too, let's not get too nerdy on the math here. What's the best way to remove opportunity of getting vulnerable women alone is making sure we protect some women only spaces. That's it. What's the best way to remove opportunity of getting vulnerable women alone is making sure we protect some women only spaces. That's it. That's all it is. And if you're pro women, you have to understand where people are coming from with that. Let's stop calling the insinuation that having women only spaces should all. So let's use the term no penis spaces, Is that okay? Can we use that? Can I say that on radio? I can say penis, right, Because it's medically No penis spaces, That's it. I am pro everyone and pro no penises in women's only spaces. And if you're pro women, you have to understand where people are coming from with that. Let's stop calling the insinuation that having women only spaces should all. So let's use the term no penis spaces, Is that okay? Can we use that? Can I say that on radio? I can say penis, right, Because it's medically No penis spaces, That's it. I am pro everyone and pro no penises in women's only spaces. It's a penis free space. I mean, now the colleges have white free spaces where no whites are allowed to go, or people you know need these bastions. Can't women have no penis spaces Like women have? Let's stop calling the insinuation that having women only spaces should all. So let's use the term no penis spaces, Is that okay? Can we use that? Can I say that on radio? I can say penis, right, Because it's medically No penis spaces, That's it. I am pro everyone and pro no penises in women's only spaces. It's a penis free space. I mean, now the colleges have white free spaces where no whites are allowed to go, or people you know need these bastions. Can't women have no penis spaces Like women have? You would think women have gyms that are just for women- And I get that- so they can go, be left alone and not to worry how they look. So let's use the term no penis spaces, Is that okay?

I mean, now the colleges have white free spaces where no whites are allowed to go, or people you know need these bastions. Can't women have no penis spaces Like women have? You would think women have gyms that are just for women- And I get that- so they can go, be left alone and not to worry how they look. for men, and men have their own gyms. There's nothing wrong with that- Actually, I haven't. The truth is, I don't think there are many. But here's the deal. What's funny to me to go on down this path? okay, Because Tucker Carlson said something about breastfeeding. And then he responded, Pete Buttgig, very snippily on CNN saying: I guess Tucker hasn't heard of bottle feeding. No, no, no, We wouldn't assume that all men bottle feed, because you have told us that men can breastfeed too. We just showed a video of that today on the show of transgender men breastfeeding. So this is the problem now is the left can't even agree to their own premises. Pete Buttigieg is trying to say: of course we know men can't breastfeed. Well, guess what? Fox and Buzzfeed and CNN and NBC say that some men can breastfeed, And AOC says that the cauliflower is racist because it's white. Cauliflower, you know what? cauliflower is one of those things that should bridge all racial divide. Yes, also heroin, by the way. heroin is one thing that white people and black people do equally. You have certain drugs that are bigger, Certain areas where you had the crack epidemic, which was largely African-American, A lot of the capitol floggers remember a few years ago they were saying milk is racist because it's white. but pulling back from the Stephen Crowder, let's get back to the transgenderism. I played for TV viewers- You obviously couldn't see it- the American psycho or psycho clip from Alfred Hitchcock of the man dressed up as the woman going around killing people. But what about, even in silence of the lambs, where it's a transgender that's got the woman down in the pit trying to get her to put lotion on the skin? Why do we art typally and just think of a man dressed up as a woman as kind of a psycho? Because we've actually seen that in the real world.

What do you think about that phenomenon? So drum roll, please. this is the Washington Post. This is not a joke, This is not a game. This is not the onion, This is not the Babylon bead. This is real. Rachel Levine, openly transgender health official, to be sworn in as four-star admiral. It's like an escape from New York, where they go down to the basement of the building and he finds a bum that has the president's tracker. He goes, Mr President, Mr President, He looks and goes: yeah, I'm the president. I'm the president, I'm a four-star admiral. How about? No, it's not true, but let's just say it. Hell, let's give her Woman of the Year award, Like Caitlyn Jenner was. Or let's give a Nobel Prize to Obama. Or let's give one to Henry Kissinger that launched war crimes everywhere and bragged about it. Hell, let's give Hitler a Southern Property Law Center ADL award. So, Rachel Levine, openly transgender health official, to be sworn in as four-star admiral. Darth Vader literally strangled the last one and said: you are in command now, admiral. There it is, ladies and gentlemen, Can you guys find the psycho clip with audio? I'm going to play some of that here in a moment, Or you know what? I haven't played it yet. There it is, ladies and gentlemen, Can you guys find the psycho clip with audio? I'm going to play some of that here in a moment, Or you know what? I haven't played it yet. I mentioned it to Stephen Crowder. Please cue up the new little meme. Oh, before they fact-check me at Reuters and say Jones played a fake video of Fauci as the transgender psychopath in Silence of the Lambs, with the woman down in the pit saying she rubs the lotion on the skin. This is called a parody, It's called a meme, It's called a joke which they know. But they fact-check even the memes we play and say Jones tried to get a fake video over on Fauci. No, that's fake, That's a joke, This isn't fake. right here, A man saying they're a woman now is an admiral. I mean, it is a fake man, a fake woman. Of course it's totally fake. Not really an admiral, It's just governments, as they begin to collapse like any third world but in a republic, start festooning, you know, four or five, six stars on everybody they can. It's like a dictator in Latin America or something. So a senior, oh senior, oh my God. Mellford Pointy, who made history when she became the nation's highest ranking openly transgender official, is also supposed to become its first openly transgender four-star officer. The administration announced on Tuesday. Rachel Levine, oh, US Secretary for Health will be sworn in Tuesday as an admiral of the US Public Health Service Commission Corps For outreach to your children. I should add A 6,000 person force that responds to health on behalf of the federal government, including administering coronavirus vaccines and delivering care after hurricanes.

We've covered the transgender depopulation, western style one-child policy program where we sterilize our young boys and condition them and brainwash them to accept transgenderism, which is again just chemical or physical mutilation and sterilization. That we covered a lot. We covered a lot of other big subjects, but right now I'm going to hit the big one That, yes, I've been harping on for 20 months every day on the show, because it is the great reset, It is the takeover, It is their new water plan in Klaus Schwab, in Bill Gates' own words. So I'm going to hit this right now. Huge stack here And they're all ties together. So when they hit you with a bio weapon and they tell you it naturally came out of a cave in China or a wet market, you believe it. They're all pre-programming you. When the bio weapon comes, it was because you were bad When you died. it's because you were bad, Okay, good, Okay, thank you. By the way, here's your new admiral. He's a transgender, Okay. so it says cardiovascular and respiratory diseases will come from the heat. So a respiratory disease is going to kill you from the heat. It says right there, from the heat.

Now, of course, liberals continue to freak out over these bathroom bills that are either in the process of passing or have passed in several states, and of course, the main battlefront is north carolina. they passed a bill called hb2, which would- god forbid- require people to use public bathrooms that correspond with the gender they were born. now, this was a reaction. it was a defensive measure against an ordinance in charlotte which would have forced private businesses to cater for transgender people and allow them to use whichever bathroom they like, depending on which gender they identify on that particular day. so this was a complete violation of the rights of private businesses, similar to what we've seen with christian bakeries. of course we've had gay activists go out and try and ruin people's lives. this was this was a vindictive measure. it wasn't a random occurrence in several examples where they go to a christian bakery, ask for a gay wedding cake and they're refused because the owners say: sorry, that doesn't accord with our beliefs. he went to a bunch of muslim owned bakeries and asked for a gay wedding cake. they refused, but there was no national hounding campaign. there was no national scandal surrounding that. so again, it's one rule for one set of people and another rule for another set of people. so they passed this bill in north carolina- there are similar bills in other states- and all it said was: in public bathrooms you have to use the bathroom which corresponds with your biological gender, which is on your birth certificate. they said: if you're a private business, feel completely free to provide transgender bathrooms or to allow transgender identifying people to use whichever bathroom they choose. so in a sense, it was a defense of rights in terms of the majority, whereas the charlotte ordinance was a violation of people's rights to cater for a minority, bearing in mind zero, point zero. three percent of the us population identifies as transgender- a tiny minority. and the point i made in a video that i put out about this is if you make the effort to look, if you're a man and you want to be a woman and you make the effort to look like a woman, then nobody is even going to notice, if you use the female bathroom, of course, what this will do- and it's already had this effect in several cases which i talk about in the video- it basically it's a loophole to allow perverts and freaks to go into women's bathrooms, and i'm not just saying that for effect. it already happened in seattle back a couple of months ago. there was no national scandal surrounding that. so again, it's one rule for one set of people and another rule for another set of people. so they passed this bill in north carolina- there are similar bills in other states- and all it said was: in public bathrooms you have to use the bathroom which corresponds with your biological gender, which is on your birth certificate. they said: if you're a private business, feel completely free to provide transgender bathrooms or to allow transgender identifying people to use whichever bathroom they choose. so in a sense, it was a defense of

the video- it basically it's a loophole to allow perverts and freaks to go into women's bathrooms, and i'm not just saying that for effect. it already happened in seattle back a couple of months ago. there was a man who, quote, made no verbal or physical attempt to identify as a woman. you know, he didn't even make the effort to put on a wig. he walked into a female bathroom in seattle and began to undress as a man. he didn't even look like a woman, but again he cited the law- quote: the law has changed and i have a right to be here. that's what this hairy creep said as he walked into a women's bathroom and began to undress. so again, this is what this kind of ordinance that we saw in charlotte is going to to make more likely. it's basically a red carpet for perverts and pedophiles. you had the case in colorado where teen girls complained about a- quote- transgender student who kept entering the girls changing room. they were threatened with hate crimes charges for doing so. so again, violating the privacy rights, violating the private business rights, the private religious rights of people- the majority- to cater for this tiny, tiny minority- 0.03 percent of the population. you know people like the, the guy who we featured a few months ago, who left his wife and family to become a woman and now now identifies as a six-year-old girl- and he's in the clip. you can go and watch the video. you had Coca-Cola, Starbucks, Microsoft, Google- all signing this letter decrying the North Carolina bill. yet they all do business in Q8, where cross-dressing is punishable by up to 10 years in prison. they didn't sign off on a letter condemning Q8. no, they only signed off on a letter condemning North Carolina because, again, god forbid- people will have to use the bathroom that correlates with their biological gender. Cirque du Soleil: they've cancelled shows in North Carolina over this bathroom bill. they haven't cancelled shows in Dubai, where being transgender is illegal, where people go to prison for this, but again, there's no virtue signaling when it comes to Dubai because, of course, that's a vastly more lucrative market. these companies have no principles whatsoever. this is all about virtue signaling. but I go back to the point. this is nothing to do with human rights. they haven't cancelled shows in Dubai, where being transgender is illegal, where people go to prison for this, but again, there's no virtue signaling when it comes to Dubai because, of course, that's a vastly more lucrative market. these companies have no principles whatsoever. this is all about virtue signaling. but I go back to the point. this is nothing to do with human rights. this was a defensive measure against an ordinance which, if it would have, you know, taken effect and become a pretext for the rest of the state, would have forced private businesses to adhere to this rule of allowing people who identify as transgender to use whichever bathroom they liked. now I don't care if you identify as Barney the purple dinosaur, but when government conspires to violate the rights of the majority to be politically correct and please a tiny minority, that's a huge problem. you don't let people who identify as six-year-old girls when they're 55 year old men use children's changing rooms, so why should you allow people who, maybe on a whim, identify as being female- female even though they're male- use the female locker room? now we're going to go to this video which ties into this. this is by youtuber joey salads, who we featured on info warscom before he does these social experiments where he puts these you know liberal sacred cows to the test. he did one a couple of weeks ago where he went out and tried to ascertain who was the most violent: Trump supporters or Bernie Sanders supporters. of course, he ended up getting physically attacked by Bernie Sanders supporters because they're vile, intolerant, hateful people, as our reporters have proven over and over again in Portland, New York and other areas over the past couple of weeks. so he basically went out and did a video testing this bathroom bill and now for you know people listening on the radio who've only got the audio- he basically just dressed up as a woman and followed women into female bathrooms to get their reaction- their organic, natural reaction- to a guy with facial hair who is dressed up as a woman, following them into the female bathroom. this is a four minute clip here. it is what's up, guys. joey salads here in north Carolina passed a bill that requires trans people to use the bathrooms that correspond with the sex listed on their birth certificate. a reset to a trans friend of mine and a doctor whom I'm also friends with, and both had some contradicting points. my trans friends told me that nobody is born to a sex or a gender and that gender and sex are a social construct and that dna and genetics have nothing to do with your sex. my doctor said that dna and genetics have everything to do with your gender at birth. you either become a male or a female. a reset to a trans friend of mine and a doctor whom I'm also friends with, and both had some contradicting points. my trans friends told me that nobody is born to a sex or a gender and that gender and sex are a social construct and that dna and genetics have nothing to do with your sex. my doctor said that dna and genetics have everything to do with your gender at birth. you either become a male or a female. with help of my trans friend. today i'm going to dress and act like a transgender. i'm then going to enter women's bathrooms and let's see how they react. all right, guys. so i'm about to make my transformation to look like a transgender. now i know that dressing up like a girl doesn't necessarily make me transgender. you either become a male or a female. with help of my trans friend. today i'm going to dress and act like a transgender. i'm then going to enter women's bathrooms and let's see how they react. all right, guys. so i'm about to make my transformation to look like a transgender. now i know that dressing up like a girl doesn't necessarily make me transgender. it would just make me a cross dresser. but on the outside, people will still think that i'm transgender. i got this information from my transgender friend and it is transgender approved. with help of my trans friend. today i'm going to dress and act like a transgender. i'm then going to enter women's bathrooms and let's see how they react. all right, guys. so i'm about to make my transformation to look like a transgender. now i know that dressing up like a girl doesn't necessarily make me transgender. it would just make me a cross dresser. but on the outside, people will still think that i'm transgender. i got this information from my transgender friend and it is transgender approved. how about?

i'm joey salads. thank you guys for watching, please, this video. like, share and subscribe. and, as you can tell from this video that most women are not comfortable sharing a bathroom with a trans person, there has to be another solution for this debate, because women are not comfortable sharing a bathroom and a trans people want to share the bathroom. so there needs to be a better solution. comment below what you think the solution needs to be. do you think that trans people should be allowed to use the bathrooms on what they associate themselves with, or do you think they need to use the bathrooms on what my doctor calls what they biologically associate with? i'm joey salads. thanks for watching. tell you the truth, okay, and that was in hollywood. so that's how liberal women react to transgender men going into the female bathroom. comment below what you think the solution needs to be. do you think that trans people should be allowed to use the bathrooms on what they associate themselves with, or do you think they need to use the bathrooms on what my doctor calls what they biologically associate with? i'm joey salads. thanks for watching. tell you the truth, okay, and that was in hollywood. so that's how liberal women react to transgender men going into the female bathroom. so they're going to virtue signal about it all day in opposing this north carolina bathroom bill. but when it's actually put to the test and a guy with a wig walks into the female bathroom, that is how they react. very telling, but of course you know that's being transphobic. but the christian bakery whose business was destroyed because it refused to make a gay wedding cake- they're bad, even though you know steven crowded- went in- did the same experiment with muslim bakeries. but the christian bakery whose business was destroyed because it refused to make a gay wedding cake- they're bad, even though you know steven crowded- went in- did the same experiment with muslim bakeries. they refused to make the cake and again nothing happened. so again that video by joey salads- which is an exclusive he gave it to us first- it's going up on youtube in a moment again proves that when liberals react to a man walking into a woman's bathroom, that's the natural organic reaction you're going to get. and that's what's going to happen if these ordinances, like the one in charlotte, are passed. so again, given that evidence, the north carolina bathroom bill makes perfect sense and you can go watch my video about it. it's linked from the alex jones channel about this transgender bathroom controversy. let's get back into some more news now. of course, before the previous segment i was talking about muslims in brussels who were dancing on the street celebrating the brussels attack. then we have this article out of breitbart: uk equalities chief, who popularized the term islamophobia, admits: i never thought muslims would blend. i thought muslims would blend into britain. this is real, and info wars view of the world is the most accurate forecast of what was going to come. and now it's here and you don't have to listen to me telling you what's going to come next. the globalists have told you what's going to come next, but don't worry, you're going to be as high as a kite when you die 30, 40 years before you're supposed to, and you'll never know what hit you as the rise of the new species of machines takes over and we are phased out. that's all been announced, that's taught at all the universities and and people under Stockholm syndrome go. well, i better join that so i can be part of the last group that has to go and give up their humanity because they're all agreeing that they have to die before they're uploaded to the mothership. this is beyond a hail bop cult, where these men cut their testicles and penises off and were transgendered and all believe that they were going to beam their spirits up to the hail bop comment. and those were some top programmers in silicon valley. where do you think this whacked out stuff comes from? they just thought they were moving to the end right away. forget uploading to the computers. And just believe me, ladies and gentlemen, that if you want somebody to commit to you and your family to fight for all of our futures together, you've got to guarantee you keep me in the game. I'm going to bust my ass with everything I got for us, for myself and my family, for your family, Because we're in this together. infowarstorecom, You're listening to the Alex Jones show. You really shouldn't be served such a thing in the war Land. parenthood does more than just kill babies and sell their body parts. For many of us, this idea of transgenderism seems brand-new.

Gender identity research began in 1962 at UCLA and the Gender Identity Clinic at Johns Hopkins was performing sex reassignment surgeries by the late 1960s. In 1969, the Marshall Tanner study created the term precocious puberty, which is defined as a disorder and diagnosed when a child shows signs of puberty too soon.

Gender identity research began in 1962 at UCLA and the Gender Identity Clinic at Johns Hopkins was performing sex reassignment surgeries by the late 1960s. In 1969, the Marshall Tanner study created the term precocious puberty, which is defined as a disorder and diagnosed when a child shows signs of puberty too soon. According to the study, too soon is age eight for girls and age nine for boys. In 2001,, the makers of Lupron paid an $875 million settlement to the Department of Justice for giving illegal kickbacks to doctors in exchange for prescribing Lupron to their patients. This company is now the sixth largest independent biotech company in the world, with a revenue of over $32 billion in 2018.. The company is also connected with the Clinton Global Initiative and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. In 2007,, Boston Children's Hospital began transitioning children as young as three years old. From 2000 to 2014,, gender-affirming surgeries have increased fourfold and up another 20% the next two years. Private funding of transgender issues increased eightfold during this time, from the Pritzker family, George Soros, Warren Buffett and others. The Department of State has allocated over $30 million of taxpayers' money to advance this agenda. Planned Parenthood is now the second largest provider of gender-affirming. Okay, folks, we're going to go to break. We're going to come back with David Ike. Okay, folks, we're going to go to break. We're going to come back with David Ike. But I mean, look at that report Gregory's just put out And that's banned on YouTube, banned everywhere. We're not going to see that anywhere but bannedvideo. It's so important. Castration, Incorporated Planned Parenthood, the business of transgenderism: that needs to be seen by everybody on the planet, especially people with children being targeted by this post-human agenda. David Ike has been on the forefront as a vanguard exposing all this, And we'll talk to him in 60 seconds. Please tell folks to tune in.

Ladies and gentlemen, a lot of people notice I've lost weight. So I want to cover the waterfront today. He's been on hiatus, writing books, making films. I was saying, hey, I've been on a couple of years, why? He said I've just had my head down. Well, he's here now and hopefully he'll come back again soon, because two hours with the breaks is not enough to cover every angle. Now I didn't know where he'd go with hundreds of pieces of this puzzle, But he said the global corporate climate takeover and transgenderism as the gateway to transhumanism, which was in my stack as the first thing I was going to bring up, knowing how key it is, without even talking to David. So we're on the same page there. But just a big picture. The globalist Elon Musk was challenging this, saying: beware those worship AI gods and they want to get rid of humans. Now he says: oh, take brain chips. It's false. it's false labeling, false programming, so that it's a jamming what the real universe is. putting up fake icons that they're teaching us through political correctness is literally to sabotage reality and not let us even to code third dimensional transmissions. But yeah, so what they're doing is they're basically putting us in a bubble, a perceptual bubble, And that's the basis of telling someone they're a victim. so you wanted to get it. trans, transhumanism and the transgender. here it is: transgender man who gave birth, loses battle to be registered as a father. That's upside down world saying you know, pig not given the right to say he can fly to the moon and back Britain's first transgender couple to allow their five year old child to begin transitioning- a total cult again doing this to their daughter.

And what they want to do with this smart grid, this connecting the human brain to artificial intelligence, is to stop us expanding our consciousness into greater levels of awareness, understanding, and that's admitted the White House science are said we put floor on the water to lower your IQ, to make you more manageable. They admit they're doing it. Talk about criminal activity, Exactly, And so that's that. that's what it's all about. Anyway, in terms of the transgender thing, this, this, this relates to the whole smart grid technological agenda. They want, in the end, to change the nature of the human body so it becomes a synthetic, a synthetic human body. They're already working on it, sometimes in the open, overwhelmingly in in the secret, bases and projects. This synthetic human will not have gender and will not be able to procreate, which takes us into brave new world and the world hatchery method of technological produce of children, which is what Aldous actually was talking about in the world hatcheries. And so what they are doing is preparing people to be young as well, because they're with the adults for the no gender world. This synthetic human will not have gender and will not be able to procreate, which takes us into brave new world and the world hatchery method of technological produce of children, which is what Aldous actually was talking about in the world hatcheries. And so what they are doing is preparing people to be young as well, because they're with the adults for the no gender world. So what? this is the process: confuse gender, confuse gender, confuse gender, confuse gender, fuse gender, fuse gender, no gender, human. And because they are looking at a technological procreation instead of a human procreation, they don't need men and women anymore because they don't need to procreate, because they're that's going to be done another way. And so what is happening with this transgender indoctrination which is so disgusting? It's not because, again, it's not about protecting transgender people from from discrimination. It's about forcing this agenda and attacking the name man and woman and attacking the very biological jump point of the third dimension. Well, in the same way that the school system, which has been completely taken over for this agenda, has been indoctrinating children into the climate cult agenda to terrify them at, the world's going to win, So they are being at the same time indoctrinated into- and boy are they back in two minutes with the final second day of the night. And then we've got all Joseph Watson. And so what they are doing is preparing people to be young as well, because they're with the adults for the no gender world.

And then we've got all Joseph Watson. The last few days I've been online looking for the speech, actually read it in a book about Winston Churchill many years ago, and I've found a few places where it's mentioned. Cyber week is here. You're listening to the Alex Jones show, Our final segment with David Ike, Paul Watson taking over. Look at this headline- wax my balls. trans activists complains that gynecologist won't see her files. more lawsuits Continuing. transgendered men again give birth- just totally made up. and then now these families Where they pressure their kids to do it. It's, it's. it's it's not turning them into another sex. it's giving them chemicals that end up killing them early. it's criminal activity in my view. and it came out of the Tabistock Institute powerful report The Gregory's put out- and I get mad at the crew because they're great people, but they like do these incredible reports and it's like no promotion. It's not brought to me Not a big deal is it made about it. We don't even get the people that we have that have Twitter accounts to put it out. It's like this: Yeah, So if you don't take our stuff serious and get it out at, banned on video, Nobody is because we got first rate reporters and stuff breaking stuff that is earth shattering Because, as David Ike just said, he's dead on the climate change system is about teaching humans to hate themselves and about turning everything over to a world government system. And the transgenderism is of getting them ready for brain chips and everything else. because if you'll accept a man's a woman and a woman's a dog or any of this other stuff, or people put Drano in their eyes because they want to be transabled and then we got to pay for their tax money to take care of them, then we'll put up with cyborgs. Closing comments on that. David Ike, and I appreciate you joining us today. Well, what have you just described? you just described George Orwell's two plus two equals five. What they're telling us is to believe that two plus two equals five, and in 1984, and there were punishments for not accepting that, even if you thought it actually equal four. And so what we have now are the punishments. You've got parents who are terrified of social services knocking on their door If they don't go along with the tyranny now school, which is actually a tyranny, which is what they've become imposing these things upon children. But if we're going to stop this, then we need to grow a pair and we need to grow a backbone and we need to not accept that two and two equals anything but four. So when people say these things, that you've just described, these ludicrous things, and you get attacked for saying, actually, that man and a woman is the biology of humans And that's not to say that people can't be transgender. good luck to them. But that's not what this is about. This is not about protecting transgender people. It's about indoctrinating kids to become confused about their gender for a big political reason.

If this was about protecting transgender people, then when those transgender people- and I've been reading books about this- come out who've been through the surgery, who've been through the transition, and say it was a big mistake. I wish I hadn't bowed to the pressure to do it because it's destroyed my life- The transgender activists, if it was about transgender people, would say hey, hey, you know if you're thinking about it, you know you need to listen to these people because they're you know they're going to be problems. no, no, what happens to those people when they come out and say I made a mistake is they are abused and vilified and demonized because it's not about transgender, it's about an agenda.

This is why, when Jewish people come out and criticize Israel, they get more abuse from the Israeli networks than non-Jewish people. So it's not about protecting Jewish people. good luck to them. But that's not what this is about. This is not about protecting transgender people. It's about indoctrinating kids to become confused about their gender for a big political reason.

This is why, when Jewish people come out and criticize Israel, they get more abuse from the Israeli networks than non-Jewish people. So it's not about protecting Jewish people. it's about protecting an agenda which has multiple faces, and what we need to do is refuse to accept that two and two equal anything but four. But that's not what this is about. This is not about protecting transgender people. It's about indoctrinating kids to become confused about their gender for a big political reason.

So when they come out with this stuff- and we need to keep, we're supposed to keep our heads down and nod. where all this craziness is going? the latest giant Islamic attacks the government covering up? where are the other seven convicted terrorists they released with him. I mean, this is all coming up this hour. please don't forget. if you spend your money with Amazon and the big box stores, you're literally giving it to places like Dick's Sporting Goods and Walmart that are anti-gun now, that are pro-transgenderism, like Target, Amazon, all the things they're doing. get your products at M4storecom. you're gonna get the best supplements. you're gonna get great Liberty based t-shirts. you're gonna get great air filtration, great water filtration, the lowest prices you're gonna find. Now they're suffering from Bell's palsy. So just all kinds of news on that front. it's just insane. I don't even know how to break all of this down. Then you have an unbelievable situation in Loudon County, Virginia, where they covered up a rape in a bathroom of a young girl. they covered up the rape of a bathroom in a young girl so they could pass transgender bathroom policies, And the individual that raped that young girl has now raped a second girl. Wow, A lot on that front. Fulton County fires people for shredding voter applications. Wow, Anti Trump people in the Navy selling nuclear secrets to foreign powers- total treason. It's just unbelievable. It's just unbelievable. And then Kamala Harris- I knew there was something weird about it. Now we know, posing with actors for a fake NASA video. it's all insane. But first let's go back to Alex with more Remember: the global social engineers are betting everything on the fact that we won't adapt and overcome to their tyranny, but that we will submit to it. That's why, with the leftist teachings, the transgenderism and all the rest of the cultural brainwashing and the forced inoculations that are inoculations, it's all comply for the greater good of society And then we'll let you go back out and go back to normal again. But now, 21 months into this nightmare, what is the BBC and CNN and MSNBC and ABC News and Derspiegel tell us? they say the new normal is that we're never going back to normal. The before time of being able to travel and have a car and have air conditioning and have children is over. We're going to cut the resources off so that you can't live. Find these and more at infowarstorecom and fund the info world, making your life a lot healthier. Now we have just highlighted a level of evil that is going on in response to this COVID, where they have a policy to put plastic bags over people's heads in a hospital. It'd be called suffocation or child abuse anywhere else, but in the hospital for COVID somehow that works. But as evil as that is, this story might be even worse And you want to try to make sense of this in your head. You only reach the worst conclusions possible, but it's always the same people doing these evil, dastardly deeds. So in Loudoun County, for some odd reason, there are school boards which are obviously Democrats, that are desperate and it's a top priority to have transgender bathrooms and or have the access of transsexuals to any bathroom be a policy, And so this is a top priority for them. Who knows why, but Democrats on school boards in Loudoun County have been trying to get either transgender bathrooms and or let transsexuals into whatever bathroom that they want to identify as, And this has been a top priority. So back in June- I guess months ago- there was a situation in Loudoun County where a transsexual individual- a male biologically- went into the female bathroom as a transsexual, allegedly or pretending to be, and raped and raped a girl. Here's here's headline in the Daily Mail: Loudoun County father who was dragged out of woke school board meeting reveals his daughter was raped in the girl's bathroom by a skirt wearing male who was arrested for assaulting a second girl months later. Now so you say, whoa, a second girl. Now we have just highlighted a level of evil that is going on in response to this COVID, where they have a policy to put plastic bags over people's heads in a hospital. It'd be called suffocation or child abuse anywhere else, but in the hospital for COVID somehow that works.

Now so you say, whoa, a second girl. well, I'm jumping forward. It'd be called suffocation or child abuse anywhere else, but in the hospital for COVID somehow that works. But as evil as that is, this story might be even worse And you want to try to make sense of this in your head. You only reach the worst conclusions possible, but it's always the same people doing these evil, dastardly deeds.

Now so you say, whoa, a second girl. well, I'm jumping forward. So the transsexual, biological male rapes a girl in the woman's bathroom at this school. Who knows why, but Democrats on school boards in Loudoun County have been trying to get either transgender bathrooms and or let transsexuals into whatever bathroom that they want to identify as, And this has been a top priority. So back in June- I guess months ago- there was a situation in Loudoun County where a transsexual individual- a male biologically- went into the female bathroom as a transsexual, allegedly or pretending to be, and raped and raped a girl.

Now so you say, whoa, a second girl. well, I'm jumping forward. So the transsexual, biological male rapes a girl in the woman's bathroom at this school. Now the Democrats on the school board are in the middle of trying to pass the official policy at the school to let men go into the bathroom with women. if they claim that they're women, if they identify as female or have transsexuals be able to go in whatever bathroom they want, just blur the lines of reality. So they covered up a rape for a political purpose. The Democrats on the Loudoun County school board covered up a rape of a girl in the women's bathroom so they could get the policy they wanted passed. Here's here's headline in the Daily Mail: Loudoun County father who was dragged out of woke school board meeting reveals his daughter was raped in the girl's bathroom by a skirt wearing male who was arrested for assaulting a second girl months later.

So they covered up a rape for a political purpose. The Democrats on the Loudoun County school board covered up a rape of a girl in the women's bathroom so they could get the policy they wanted passed. And they had the father of the girl who was raped removed from school board meetings because they didn't want that information getting out. because hey, yeah, you're trying to pass policy to let men go into the female bathrooms and you just had a rape. Now they're basically shut down, And it's the same thing with every other institution they want to take over. So this is how they put these operatives in. They know that once they do this, there's going to be a bunch of rapes and a bunch of abuse. They encourage male predators to say they're women, to get women pregnant in prison, you name it, saying they're women. They then rape the women. They have been raped to little girls, just like Andrew Cuomo said famously on CNN: hey, if your 10-year-old daughter doesn't like seeing a man's penis, well she's a hate-monger. Because people said on CNN: hey, they're wanting to put full-grown men in the girl's showers, They're wanting to have the male soccer coach, the male basketball coach, say he's a woman in the showers, Because if they get you to do that, you'll accept anything. So this is how they corrupt institutions. This is how they come in and take over groups. Same thing with COVID. they admit it- is the phallates and the chemicals in the plastics that make boys feminine and girls go into puberty earlier. That's what genital sizes are shrinking testosterone's way down. Oh, Alice, I've got a story on that testosterone right here. I'm going to cover that. I think that maybe we're the problem here. I guess if a transsexual person walks into the men's room or the girls' room and says, hey, I'm going to have my way with you and you don't want that, I guess that makes you the bigot. I mean the trannies going into bathrooms. I guess they should just be allowed to do whatever they want. Alice, I mean, how dare us Remember the convicted rapist who went into the women's spa in LA and went into the hot tub with the naked women and said: you know, this is my genitals, I want to have sex with you. And the left came out. We're all being vindicated right now. So now's the time to not send our laurels Push even harder Back to Alan Shroyer. It really is an incredible thing to sit here and see what the future of humanity is faced with, or America is faced with, and just the lack of resistance, the lack of obstacles, making them just railroad us to the point where they can shut down businesses. They can mandate experimental medicine that is unnecessary for most of the population. They can cover up sexual abuse industrial level by Jeffrey Epstein. They can cover up sexual abuse on a local level because they want to have transgender bathrooms. New numbers are now coming out that since Biden announced the vaccine mandate- which doesn't exist, it was just an edict- 4.3 million Americans have lost their jobs. So, like I said, I can't even get through all the news here on my desk that's so important without important news just stacking up on top of it. Now we're going to be joined by a nurse, Danny, who is going to come on and talk about the vaccine mandates and why she chose not to get it and the tyranny happening at hospitals, And I've just got so much more here to cover, including. I don't even know how to analyze this. Arizona State Representative Wendy Rogers wants less letters, more arrests. Well, yeah, that's how you deal with criminals: You don't write letters, You arrest them. and that's why we have so much criminal activity in our country: because we just talk about it. We talk about the illegal immigration, We talk about the illegal vaccine mandates and it just continues. Again. Loudon County schools tried to conceal sexual assault against the daughter in the bathroom, against the father, against a girl in the bathroom, so that they could get the transgender bathroom bill passed. Really sick stuff. Outrage after man who stabbed high school sophomore to death and watched him die, then hit the murder weapon, gets acquitted, Wow, Wow. Now can you imagine again if the roles were reversed? I won't even tell you what the racial deal here is, but I bet you can guess. This is a fact. Every human being in this room, every human being on Earth, had to pass through the legs of a woman to be on Earth. Oh my God, I'm literally shaking. He said what Gender was a fact? No, cancel him. Civil rights groups and irate Twitter activists reacted with a perfectly calm and measured response by claiming that Chappelle was inciting the mass murder of transgender people, With 2021 on track to be the deadliest year on record for transgender people in the United States, the majority of whom are black transgender people. Netflix should know better. Really, Have more than a quarter of transgender people tried to commit suicide because of Netflix comedy specials? Or is there another reason for that figure being so high? Jacqueline Moore, who stars in Netflix's series Dear White People, threatened to stop working with Netflix as long as they continue to put out and profit from blatantly and dangerously transphobic content.

Can take a joke. Yeah, normally people who can take a joke don't literally lobby to ban jokes about them. Meet the new Dave Chappelle: misogynistic, anti-trans and socially irresponsible. And there I was thinking. Given that they banned audience reviews of the Fauci propaganda movie entirely, I'm surprised they didn't do the same to Chappelle. Can't get any bad reviews if you don't allow reviews. genius. Part of the backlash to people like Chappelle and Ricky Gervais, challenging the increasingly monopolistic cultural power of the alphabet people, is woke comedians asserting that they're punching down and attacking helpless, underrepresented minority communities. Take a look at this example from British comedian James Acaster who, despite not being funny, has been lavishly rewarded with a big mainstream platform. They walk straight on stage top of their specials, sometimes do ten solid minutes just slagging off transgender people. Oh yeah, because you know it's been long overdue a challenge. the trans community- Oh, they've had their guard down for too long. if you ask me, They'll all be checking their privilege on the way home now, thanks to you, your brave little sis boy. The entire foundation of this joke is based on the premise that the LGBT lobby is some kind of persecuted, anti-establishment underground resistance movement. In reality, the LGBT movement is the establishment. Their flag is literally flown over every government building and cultural institution, and now even outside US embassies. The trans flag literally flew over Parliament Square in London for an entire month this summer. Because what could be more edgy and anti-establishment than having your colours proudly displayed in the capital city of a major country by the royal institution of chartered surveyors? Oh my God, so edgy. In the UK, you can literally be arrested and thrown in prison for making playful jokes about trans people. A 50-year-old mother in Scotland was charged with a transphobic hate crime after she retweeted an image of a suffragette ribbon. People face scorn, intimidation and harassment. Familiarly insisting that women's spaces in sports shouldn't be dominated by biological men, Glenn Greenwald was savaged by Twitter mobs merely for discussing the results of a Gallup poll on trans identification. In the UK, our two major establishment political parties are afraid of using the word woman for fear of offending the trans lobby When your movement has the power to control thought by changing language, When you can rely on the power of the media to dehumanize and destroy your critics while relying on the power of the state to have them arrested, That kind of suggests that you're not an oppressed minority group anymore and that, in fact, you are the establishment. I'm Team Turf. I agree. I agree, man Gender is a fact. So there you have it, and we have updates on this vital, pressing cultural issue. today, Post-millennial reports, Netflix fires three employees who tried to force their way into an executive meeting over Dave Chappelle's alleged transphobia. And again, I've seen other clips of this special and people who've watched the entire thing have told me He spends half of the special genuflecting and basically bigging up transgender people and saying he doesn't want to offend them, he loves them, And then there are two little segments where he has a little poke at them and basically says: no, people should still be able to argue that biological gender exists And they've literally had purple-haired, obese social justice warriors, as you can see in this article, try to force their way into an executive meeting where the company discussed how they should handle comedian Dave Chappelle's stand-up special. The good news is that Netflix stands by Dave Chappelle after calls for censorship. This is out of ReclaimTheNetorg, in a rare win for free speech in the current online climate. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sanderos said that the Dave Chappelle special released last week will not be cancelled because of autistic freedom, Bearing in mind that people like Dave Chappelle and Ricky Gervais are, because of their massive platform, kind of privileged outliers. the vast majority of comedians, the vast majority of political commentators who poke fun at the alphabet. I mean, to be honest, I'm really not even their enemy. They just hate me for my free speech and my pro-human views. They actually look at me like hey, you're educated, you're smart, you're in good shape. They really don't want to kill me. They'd rather have a bunch of people like me running around. They see gay people, they see trans people, they see old people, they see fat people. They literally want you dead And, in case you haven't noticed, that's why all the propaganda is aimed at you and aimed at women's wombs and children. It's a population control agenda and when they see gay people having gay sex, like in the 80s, they literally wanted you dead, so they gave you a killer drug. I want to thank folks that got part one in the three-part Founder Series at 1776coincom or m4storecom, and the second installment is the Tree of Liberty Thomas Jefferson quote must be watered with the blood of patriots and tyrants. It's a coin I designed. end of sentence. stop Stop saying COVID. So this, this, this story, has that same energy, has that same vibe. COVID horror virus may cause brain damage, even in patients with mild respiratory symptoms. So you hear all this stuff about long COVID and COVID does this. COVID, COVID makes your penis shrink and COVID makes you lose hair and COVID makes you have brain damage and all this stuff. and- and I understand the immediate reaction to all of this, which which I tend to have as well- which is: hey, we've been lied to you so much about COVID, you've done so much fear mongering over COVID. I don't believe any of this crap. So part of me says, oh, brain damage from COVID probably just fear mongering BS like everything else. But see, here's the problem and this is why I say it's the same energy as COVID did this. So part of me says, oh, brain damage from COVID probably just fear mongering BS like everything else. But see, here's the problem and this is why I say it's the same energy as COVID did this. COVID did this. no, the government did this. Let's say: everything they tell you about COVID is true. in regards to long COVID, or brain damage or penis shrinkage or all this other stuff they tell you, let's say it's all true. Well, again, COVID was made in a lab. it's a man made virus. So if you're going to be talking about how this virus acts differently than every other virus known in human history, and you're going to be talking about all these horrific long term effects and that's why you can't get it and that's why you should always wear the mask and never leave your house again and all this other stuff, Okay, So why aren't we mad at the people that created and released this on us? So what is the breakdown here? Oh, COVID is causing long term problems and brain damage and all this stuff. Okay, well, who's responsible? Who made the virus? Who released the virus? So it's all this fear mongering. If you get COVID, your penis is going to shrink and you're going to have brain damage so that you're scared to death forever. You never take the mask off, You never give control of your life or take control of your life back from the government. You give it to them permanently in this state of permaphore and then you never blame the parties responsible, the individuals that made it in a lab. So just remember this When they tell you stories about long COVID and lung damage and brain damage and genital damage and all this stuff. thanks Anthony Fauci and Peter Dossick and everybody else that knew that this came in a lab and funded this research in a lab and it's just: oh, fear over COVID. And that's me. And when it comes to gay issues, I'm not programmed that it's a gay. I just say: live and let live. You want to be gay, be gay. You want to be lesbian, be lesbian. You want to be transsexual? It's weird. It's strange, It's confused. I think it's mental illness. And if you want to be be it, You just changed my screen. I think it's mental illness. And if you want to be be it, You just changed my screen. So there we go, There we go. It's back. Now I can see what I'm looking at. So okay, you want to be transsexual, be transsexual. But number one: if it affects me, it's a different story. If it doesn't affect me, if you're gay in your bedroom, I don't see it, I don't care, None of my business. But you have no right. First of all, I've always argued about transsexual issues. Now I can see what I'm looking at. So okay, you want to be transsexual, be transsexual. But number one: if it affects me, it's a different story. If it doesn't affect me, if you're gay in your bedroom, I don't see it, I don't care, None of my business. But you have no right. First of all, I've always argued about transsexual issues. You have no right to stuff men down by throat in a women's bathroom. You have no right to stuff men down little girl's throats in a locker room setting, in a sports setting, on a field trip setting. Men can't be women, Little boys can't be girls- And I had all my daughters. And you have no right to take little girls' scholarships away and trophies away when boys start playing girl sports. You have no right to stuff men down by throat in a women's bathroom. You have no right to stuff men down little girl's throats in a locker room setting, in a sports setting, on a field trip setting. Men can't be women, Little boys can't be girls- And I had all my daughters. And you have no right to take little girls' scholarships away and trophies away when boys start playing girl sports. All of that is nuts. Number two: you have no right to stuff transgenders down the military's throat. You have no right to say transgender should be in the military, because if they're in the military, the reason why isn't because they're brave heroes, it's because they want free transgender surgery. sex change surgery costs 100 to $150,000.. Look at your screen. Aren't you proud of that? There's your military dollars in action. You have no right to stuff men down little girl's throats in a locker room setting, in a sports setting, on a field trip setting. Men can't be women, Little boys can't be girls- And I had all my daughters. And you have no right to take little girls' scholarships away and trophies away when boys start playing girl sports. All of that is nuts. Number two: you have no right to stuff transgenders down the military's throat. You have no right to say transgender should be in the military, because if they're in the military, the reason why isn't because they're brave heroes, it's because they want free transgender surgery. sex change surgery costs 100 to $150,000.. Look at your screen. Aren't you proud of that? There's your military dollars in action. But here's the deal. This person could be whoever they want to be- strange, weird to normal people. but you have no right to take my taxpayer money and have a sex change operation in the military or in prison. No taxpayer dollars should ever be spent because a person's mixed up and confused what their sexual identity is. So I'm not anti-gay, I'm anti-all of that, which is ridiculous. Now along comes this new stuff that I had no idea that our children were being groomed in kindergarten, first grade, second grade and third grade. It's literally to be gay, to be lesbian, to be transgender, to change their sexual identity and to think that's a good thing. And I don't believe there's very many parents in America who approve of that Liberal or conservative. I think the Virginia election proved that while the mama bears came out and they elected the Republican governor of Virginia. that no one thought was possible. No one thought it was even possible. I think the Virginia election proved that while the mama bears came out and they elected the Republican governor of Virginia. that no one thought was possible. No one thought it was even possible. Virginia's become not purple but a blue state, But yet it turned big time red. they elected a Republican governor and an old Republican legislature. over the issues of critical race theory in school, school closures for COVID, masks in school, vaccines in school and transgender sexual identity education taught in school. All of that led to all the mothers of Virginia switching to the Republican Party. So if Democrats want to make this their hill to die on, as the saying goes, fame is saying- and I'm not talking about violence here, I'm not talking about murdering anybody. please don't misconstrue my words. a hill to die on is one of the most famous sayings in history. And if Democrats want to make this issue their hill to die on- I'm talking about the political party's death, I'm talking about their campaigns being destroyed- then you make it the hill to die on. I'm all for it. I'm cheering you, I'm gonna high five you. it's great. make it the hill to die on. make it the centerpiece issue of the Democrat Party that transsexuality, transgender identity, changing your sexual identification, gay and lesbian education from kindergarten through third grade should be taught in all the schools. you do that and you watch what happens, in November you're gonna lose all 50 states. you're not gonna lose 50, 60 seats in a house landslide, you're gonna lose 80 to 100 seats in a house landslide. you're gonna lose the Senate by 10 seats. you're gonna be slaughtered, politically destroyed, demolished. Disney will put all their prestige and credibility and power and money behind stopping the wonderful new law in Florida by Governor Ron DeSantis. that should be the law of the land. it should not be the law of Florida. it should be the law of every state in America that you cannot groom and brainwash children between kindergarten and third grade and it should be the law. you can't brainwash them between kindergarten and 12th grade in all 50 states. it's not a school's job to say gay is bad, transgender is bad or gay is good, transgender is good. public schools should stay completely out of politics and religion. it's none of their business. it's parents' job to teach children whether gay is good or gay is bad- none of your business. and transgenders, kindergartners don't need to know about it and it shouldn't be taught anymore. you can't brainwash them between kindergarten and 12th grade in all 50 states. it's not a school's job to say gay is bad, transgender is bad or gay is good, transgender is good. public schools should stay completely out of politics and religion. it's none of their business. it's parents' job to teach children whether gay is good or gay is bad- none of your business. and transgenders, kindergartners don't need to know about it and it shouldn't be taught anymore. But the mayor, one minute to go, the mayor of New York City, Eric Adams, who was supposed to be a moderate Democrat, is now paying for a billboard campaign in Florida that if you don't like how they're treating you as a gay person, please move to New York. and I'm just laughing. first of all, there's no parent, no normal parent, in America that doesn't like this new law in Florida- none. so it shows that Eric Adams was a liar and a fraud. And suddenly everyone I've ever known in my life comes out of the woodwork and says: I saw you at Alex Jones today. That just tells you that Alex Jones is kind of the secret passion of so many people in this country who maybe don't brag to everyone in the world. they watch him because they're nervous of what people think. They're nervous to say I'm a Trump fan. They're nervous to say I'm a Republican or a conservative. They're nervous to say I don't support transgender education to kindergartners. They're scared to lose their jobs And Alex Jones is high up on that list They may be scared to tell the world. I watch Alex Jones every day, but they do, clearly, because I get as many people seeing me on this as I've ever gotten on Fox News or anything else I've ever done in my entire life. So that's the deal: Some of the stories that are important out there. remember, I said at the beginning of the show that I said the election was rigged and stolen in 2020.. And, of course, the media ignored it and told me I'm a terrible person and I'm a fool and I'm a liar. The election was stolen, the election was stolen. the election was stolen. And the number one thing you need to ask every Republican running for every office in America in every GOP primary coming up this year in the coming few weeks and months is: do you believe the 2020 election was rigged and stolen against President Trump and any candidate who says no or who hymns and hoes or whose talks in a circle and won't give you an answer, knock them out, never let them win. We don't want one candidate running for office as a Republican who won't admit the election was stolen. And why did they rig and steal the election? It's happening right now so they can brainwash your children with transgender and with sexual identity education, And so they could brainwash your children with critical race theory. And so they can mask us and vaccine, mandate us and lock us down for the rest of our lives. And so they can open the borders and let everyone in. So no Republican will ever win an election again and you change the demographics of America. So America isn't filled with Americans anymore, It's filled with foreigners who actually hate America and hate you and want to outvote you and give themselves welfare for the rest of their lives while you starve and the money's redistributed from you to them as an American citizen, to an illegal alien. and now you find out Black Lives Matter purchased $6 million Los Angeles mansion with their donors money. This is not the first time this has come out in the news. This was in the news this morning, but I've seen it 20 times in the last few months that the founders of Black Lives Matter, who started out with nothing, who are all communists, mostly communist lesbians, who hate men and don't want men to head households, and they communist, lesbian, black lives matter founders, suddenly have multi-million dollar homes, Lots of them. Where do you think the money came from? It's all fraud, Complete fraud. Here's another great story: California city to give universal income to transgender residents and non-binary residents, regardless of earnings. So Palm Springs has decided to give basically $1,000 a month to anyone who's transgender, even if you make a million dollars a year Because if you're transgender, somehow they believe you deserve it. I don't know, It's so bizarre. I always said affirmative action is absolutely absurd, because if it's racist to say you can't have a job because you're black, it's just as racist to say you can't have a job because you're white. and I'm going to give it to a black person who may not be qualified for the job, but I gave it to him because the color of their skin- and this is the exact same story- Because you're born transgender or because you think you've changed your identity and now you are non-binary?

Are you a fish? Are you a frog? Do you think you could change from male to female depending on your mood of the day, and tomorrow you're a man and the next day you're a woman? I believe he has 80 million votes in the last election. Disney has made it easy to hate Disney. They have no one but themselves to blame. Disney has chosen a hill to die on. there's that famous saying. again, they want to overturn the new Florida law that stops the indoctrination of little children from pre kindergarten through third grade with woke sexual gender identity, brainwashing and transgender equality education. Keep in mind we're only talking about five to eight year olds. What parent could possibly disagree with stopping the brainwashing of kindergarten through third grade, five to eight year olds? What parent visiting Disney could possibly disagree, whether it's Disney World or Disneyland? What parent could disagree? You want to do that? Do it. America's a free country, But I hope she and her Disney board of directors and her Disney CEO and her Disney chairman of the board have no problem if I have free speech and if conservatives like me, tens of millions of us and Christians and patriots decide to never again visit any Disney theme park. There is the president of Disney television on the screen right now. She made a point of bragging that she has two children. One is transgender and the other is gender fluid. Folks, I don't even know what these mentally ill people are talking about and I don't really care. I just want them to keep their education away from my children. They're brainwashing away from my children And you know what else? They're strange children away from my children. I can run 10 miles. I do some pretty heavy work, uh, with a highway department and my friends will attest to the fact that, yeah, for a guy in his sixties, you know, pushing 70, I'm- and I'm not just blowing smoke here- the B12 saves my life. if you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.The Washington State Senate just passed Senate Bill 5599, allowing the state to hide children from their parents. No allegation of abuse is required, just the child's delusional desire to change the gender of their own body. The bill compels state-licensed youth shelters to act as accomplices in castrating children without their parents' knowledge and allocates over $7 million to pay for the surgical and pharmaceutical castrations. According to this new law, if a child shows up at a youth shelter in Washington State and expresses the desire to change the gender of their body, claiming that their parents are against it, then the youth shelter is legally obligated to not notify the parents of the child's location, but rather to funnel that child into the destructive and horrific world of transgenderism, paid for by the state of Washington with taxpayer dollars. And it's not limited to Washington residences. Any young, confused, runaway child can now make their way to Washington to get castrated by the government without their parents ever being notified. The agenda to destroy Christian culture and the family was further demonstrated last month when scores of UN judges published the eight March Principles for a Human Rights-Based Approach to Criminal Law proscribing conduct associated with sex, reproduction, drug use, HIV, homelessness and poverty. The document states that these principles should be of immediate relevance to legislators, judges and prosecutors at all levels.

The document states that these principles should be of immediate relevance to legislators, judges and prosecutors at all levels. These principles include the right to abortion and transgender surgeries. They recommend the legalization of prostitution and all drug use. But the real offense is buried at the end of Principle 16, Consensual Sexual Conduct, where it states that sexual conduct involving persons below the domestically prescribed minimum age of consent to sex may be consensual, in fact, if not in law. In this context, the enforcement of criminal law should reflect the rights and capacity of persons under 18 years of age to make decisions about engaging in consensual sexual conduct and their rights to be heard in matters concerning them. And the reason for this was perhaps best summarized by Communist Marxist Vladimir Lenin when he said: give me four years to teach the children and the seed I have sown will never be uprooted. Now let's hear from one of the soldiers of this cult of death. If you back a wild animal into a corner, they're going to become a dangerous animal. So if you want to die on that hill of yours of righteousness and moral majority, then you go right ahead. I dare you to try and stop me from going into a women's bathroom. It will be the last mistake you ever make. I dare you to try and stop a transgender woman in my presence from using the bathroom. It will be the last mistake you ever make. This is a call to action and a call to arms to everybody within the United States that are scared, worried, have children that are transgender, lesbian, bi or gay. This is a call to action. You need to arm up, plain and simple. So if you want to die on that hill of yours of righteousness and moral majority, then you go right ahead.

You need to arm up, plain and simple. Go out, buy a gun, learn how to use it efficiently, through and through, because the time to act is now. You need to protect yourself and you need to protect your fellow transgender brothers and sisters, and they's and them's. It will be the last mistake you ever make. This is a call to action and a call to arms to everybody within the United States that are scared, worried, have children that are transgender, lesbian, bi or gay. This is a call to action.

You need to protect yourself and you need to protect your fellow transgender brothers and sisters, and they's and them's. You need to protect the rest of us in the LGB community, as I'm going to do myself, because there are lots of people like me who are not afraid to die. I love my girlfriends to death, but I would rather die for them to secure their safety, freedom and future than to live and not have anything done. This is the army of Satan. You go ahead. It's about destroying the family and setting up a system based on pedophilia. That was the German government slash CIA experiment, The German experiment that placed foster children with pedophiles. Now you're like- well, that's just the German government Across West Germany. The program ended after the merger of Germany, but it's now gone operational. It's not hidden now, it's out in the open. Oh, we're not pedophiles, we're transgender advocates. We're going to form a sexual identity relationship with your child and guide them sexually in their life. I mean, if you were married to somebody for, say, five years, you loved them, they were great, And then you have a child, and when the child's six, it's a man or woman, be the husband or the wife and you catch them telling your son or daughter that you could be another sex or telling them that they wanted to have sex with adults. that's okay. You'd call the police, You'd divorce that person, You'd get custody. I'm going to get directly into the actual UN report. that's even worse and will legalize pedophilia worldwide. here it is: The Washington State Senate just passed Senate Bill 5599, allowing the state to hide children from their parents.

I mean, this is just next level, ladies and gentlemen. California bill proposes fines, jail time for those who harass teachers over gendered ideology and teaching. That means criticizing them at the school boards. Remember sending the FBI to the school boards two years ago? So this is very, very, very serious. Washington bill to allow medical transgender interventions on minors without parental consent. But that's not even the meat of it, It's the taking the child away. So that's just some of the information. Then we've got this happening. Illegal aliens who are LGBTQ, including children, may not be detained under Democrats' new bill. He can't talk. That's what they want, Total puppets. We have more universities protesting saying they don't want armed police on campus- Total idiots. That turns the campus obviously into a giant shooting gallery where these mass killers will go. But that just shows the abject murder of logic, common sense by the left. Also, House Republicans pass bill to ban transgender athletes and women and girls sports. We're getting more to that in a moment. And House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries says men and women's sports is an issue that doesn't exist. And he goes on to say it doesn't exist because there are no men in women's sports, Because when you identify as a woman, you are a woman. And now the University of Texas, of all places, two days ago announced that, along with a lot of other universities, that they're teaching in the biology classes- you're paying for this- a degree that gender has nothing to do with chromosomes and is not biological. let's play yesterday's clips and the new clips back to back.

Let's find out who this little coward is, this little clown shoe. Let's find out who they are. Go ahead, buckaroo, because they won't do a damn thing. When I tell them I'm a trans woman, they'll say okay, and they'll leave me alone. You want to know why? Because it's legal in my state, as a trans woman, to use the bathroom I identify with.

And now in both Tennessee And in Kentucky it's coming out that they're suppressing the manifestos. but reportedly in both cases they were leftists who were anti-gun. and in the case of the Tennessee shooter, the woman who thought she was a man was mad about trans issues. You saw the media say, well, these are Christians and you better be nice to trans people or they'll kill you. You saw all these different Democrats come out and agree with that, including the spokesperson for the governor of Arizona. Officials in Tennessee say release of trans national shooter's manifesto was being stalled by the FBI but that they have talked to those that have seen it and it's because they were leftist. That's the same thing. Medicated Louisville bank shooter's manifesto reveals anti-gun motivation. In the last month I got a little busy so I didn't sign the books. We didn't have them for sale, But now I signed the last books. You can get them right now. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones.

See, Oh, it was just ban the N-word at first. Now, oh, you can't say that you don't want your child sterilized. You can't just not agree, You must affirm: What a cult, What a group of authoritarians. They mean business, Oh. and then states that investigate parents that are trying to get their kids sterilized at age six or seven, which you should be investigating those people? Oh, that's bad, That's abusive of transgender youth. Radical gender theory has progressed rapidly from the assertion that sex and gender are two different things, one biological and one socialized, to some asserting that biological sex is either not real or on a spectrum. We introduced some people who are called detransitioners. These are people who are choosing to reverse the process. Hormones do have implications. These are people who are choosing to reverse the process. Hormones do have implications. They have long-term effects, and they have. And of course surgery has lifelong effects. They're not reversible. Medical experts, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, say gender-affirming care is safe and best practice for transgender patients advise: Back it up 10 again. And these same groups told us it's safe for pregnant women to take vaccines and experimental shots, even though until five years ago they would all tell you don't do it, it's deadly, it's dangerous, They're lying, they're bought off and it's a wall of fraud from the top selling this death, Continue not to encourage children to change their names and pronouns.

This particular curriculum was out of what Oregon Got, another one being used here in Florida And you've got to go read what they do for the children. This is done in the middle school. middle school Flash 2 edition, Identity terms. And they just say: What are you Female, queer, cisgender, gay, transgender, trans gender? You don't learn reading, writing or arithmetic. You learn this Gender fluid- bisexual, straight, male, lesbian. And then it goes into here talking about: Do you like boys? If you feel attracted, meaning friendly, towards them, it means you want to have sex with them. Anybody that has even a 50 IQ level has recognized that. he is still pushing the death needles and we know that these things are killing people, causing immune problems, and now it has also been shown that they are causing people's faces to begin to glow orange under UV lights. So if you have taken the shot or been exposed or had sexual intercourse or been around people that have taken the shot- I've seen those reports and I meant to get to that. Yeah, it's literally creating a prion matrix in the body. This is just so devastating, Yeah. so all of this transgender nonsense and all that stuff, it's horrible. It is blatantly in the face of the teachings of God and the Bible, but really it's kind of to distract us from the fact that they are attempting to mutate humans into something else and they can't hide it anymore. Some people have begun to display ultraviolet, sort of a bluish light on their hands in some cases, and this is real, unfortunately. And don't forget the magnets. The magnets right after you get the shot- 100%- are sticking to people. You know I typed. if you want to, I'll do a little infomercial for you. otherwise I'll get right to my question. No, no, do the infomercial, I'll hold you over. then you can make your political point, go ahead.

I have it. and I just got the new Turbo Force Plus and I've been mixing it with the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, which the taste is absolutely phenomenal together. Yeah, and you know, everything was good at the Catholic school for quite a while and a new principal came in from Gonzaga Prep and Hold on, I don't want to cut you short, Hold for two more minutes. We're going to come right back to you, Okay, please, Jen. Yep, you got me. I noticed I went to you a little bit late and I'm sorry. My mother is a Baptist but also a sense of family that was Methodist, So she would go to the first Methodist to Austin that's been here since the city was built a hundred plus years ago And overnight they brought in preachers, like 10 years ago. that went from being classic liberals, anti-war, good people, to being like we're transgender, your kids belong to us. She taught Sunday school there, had to stop doing it, But then she went around and checked all the other major Methodist churches the same year to the same thing. It's the same thing. They hit us all at once. They're taking everything over. All right, Faz Man in Hawaii, I'm jealous. What island are you on? How are you doing Alex? Hi, I'm on Oahu. All right, brother, What's on your mind? Yeah, I want to talk about Michael Obama, talking about all this transgender stuff. No, I believe Michelle Obama is a man. We make jokes about it and stuff. But Joan Rivers said: look, I've seen Michelle Obama at the 2004 or 2008 Democrat National Convention And Michelle Obama has the shoulders of a linebacker And if you look at early photos of him with Obama, it's a man And absolutely. And then you learn in his own book, Dreams of My Father, he talks about how he was raised by a transgender woman in Indonesia. All right, brother, What's on your mind? Yeah, I want to talk about Michael Obama, talking about all this transgender stuff. No, I believe Michelle Obama is a man. We make jokes about it and stuff.

And then you learn in his own book, Dreams of My Father, he talks about how he was raised by a transgender woman in Indonesia. So, yes, I think this is all. I believe that Big Mike is Big Mike. Go ahead and make your point. Well, I mean, all we have is the Joan Rivers video. Well, let me make your point, because I've been interrupting. I don't know what your point was, But have you seen them come out of Harvard or whatever school? they put their daughters in, the supposed daughters that look nothing like Obama or nothing like Big Mike, that reportedly are adopted from another family? The point is it's the Truman Show. Have you seen Michelle Obama Guys pull up. Michelle Obama comes out of university in large penis and pants- I think that's what it is- And, look, we all know what it looks like when somebody's not wearing underwear, Okay, And Michelle Obama walks out, They get in the car, She comes downstairs, He comes downstairs And it looks like a giant rubber snake is in her pants, Okay, And you can see it bouncing up and down. You can see the testicles right through the pants bouncing around, bigger than Dallas. Okay, And I haven't covered this in years. You just called in about it, so it'll take us time to find it, Guys, Michelle Obama, man, Yeah, here it is, Here it is. Now slow this down and blow it up, Okay. You said you can't just go up with Joan Rivers. You're the one that raised it. But I mean I just showed you. Obviously you're not watching. I just showed you video of Michelle Obama adjusting. clearly a flaccid penis and testicles bouncing around, And anybody that's a guy knows what it looks like. I appreciate your call. Since you mentioned Joan Rivers, she died about a month after she said this. Here it is: The United States will see the first gay president or the first woman president. We already have it with Obama, so let's just calm down, Got it? clearly a flaccid penis and testicles bouncing around, And anybody that's a guy knows what it looks like. I appreciate your call. Since you mentioned Joan Rivers, she died about a month after she said this. Here it is: The United States will see the first gay president or the first woman president. We already have it with Obama, so let's just calm down, Got it? You know Michelle is a trans- I'm sorry, she's a what A transgender We all know. We all know And I don't hate Michelle Obama because she was a man that wants to be a woman. It's that I hate the policies of Michelle Obama And let me tell you nothing pisses them off more than I was talking about this, nothing. There's a bunch of other videos, but I really don't want to air videos of Michelle Obama's junk bounced around, Like now that I started thinking about it, there's like 15 other videos more that I mean it's just bam bam bouncing around. I mean give me a break, man, Give me a break. We all know And I don't hate Michelle Obama because she was a man that wants to be a woman.

Okay, Like I said, if I was a woman- and I'm not packing the Tyrannosaurus Rex, you know, foot long like- uh, it's not, you know not small, but it's not, that's probably flaccid. six inches in the pants Probably got a foot and a half long penis there, I mean that's. I mean big Mike's, got big Mike and star in major porn movies here, And so if you saw me at the beach and I and I was dressed up in a wig and stuff, but you could see I got a bulge in my pants. I mean, come on, man, I'm a man, I've got testicles and I've got a penis, Okay, And you can see, if I'm at the beach, even in baggy shorts or whatever, that I've got something in there. Well, I mean, Michelle Obama has got an Anaconda in his pants. I mean it's ridiculous.

The guy's walking around with a giant ding-a-ling bouncing around and we're looking at the damn thing and they're like two men can have a baby. The shot works. And I saw this video a few days ago and actually read about this two years ago when Gates was trying to bring it forward. And the government doesn't even do a process of approval. now He runs it, They just bring it forward And it's a bunch of estrogen, mimicking liquid plastic chemicals that they synthesize out of plant Protein. so they go: oh, it's just a plant product, It's safe. Well, you can take a plant or oil as well, anything that's carbon, And you can make whatever chemical you want by manipulating it. So it basically is a transgender cocktail, And I told you about this 20 years ago or more. And of course, now it's mainstream news that the chemicals and food and water are manipulating our endocrine systems, making men effeminate, making women hyper effeminate, And the left spins that goes since it came out. Well, let's make women more powerful. Well, no, it makes a woman age. So a woman goes into puberty at five instead of twelve And then she goes to menopause at thirty five. thanks for calling, thanks for holding. you're on the air. Hello, Yes, welcome, Hi, hi, Alex, It's taking me a long time to do this. I'm really bad on the phone. Well, you sound good, so tell us what's on your mind, Alright, so I've got three things I just wanted to go over really, really quick and then hang up because I'm nervous as hell. Okay, so, on the joking side, Kamala Harris is a man as well as Big Mike, And, on that subject back in the day, wasn't a transvestite a man that dressed up as a woman, As in today's world, even men with you know slongs are still considered like they're transgender. Isn't there a wash there or I don't know? that was the first subject on the funny side, Right? so, Alex, you've given me hope on days that I thought you know we didn't have any as a human race. Are you still there? Why don't you have a message your cousin? You know I love you and I want you to live a happy life, and I don't know what you're going through, but I don't think taking drugs and surgery is going to fix what the problem is, And if you ever need support from me or our other family members, we're here for you. I interrupted you. You said it's affecting you personally. Continue. Yeah, No, the issue of like transgenders and affects me personally because I see, I see my classmates and, like I said, my cousin and I really want to know how I can help combat it in my life and prevent my friends from being Well. I mean, it's a cult. They're trying to suppress those that have been hurt and just explain that it's a whole eugenics called targeting disadvantaged youth and confuse people and that it's a depopulation plan and just know that it's going to blow up in their face just like metaverse, like everything else. they push and just speak out as much as you can and then go speak at city council as a young person and then everyone will talk about the school. You know you're calling in to talk radio right now. So I wanted to just say real quick that I've been calling my representatives here in Texas And there's their clueless about what's going on with cattle and the MRA. So they're not doing it yet with the cattle except test. They've been doing it for four years with pigs. Right, Right, And there, there, there was a new article that came out today and it was from whole cows dot com And it says there are states that that are considering legislation, including North Dakota, Tennessee, Arizona, Idaho and Missouri, And legislation to block it. Yes, Right, Tom Ramsey, the tip of the spear on that. And we're banning transgender garbage after kids. We are fighting back, We are winning. Just if I could say real quick: any any of the employers, if y'all could please call your reps. I don't want this in my food for my kids, my family. Just please call your reps, Let them know because they're freaking clueless. today, Society is collapsing around us. every form of crime and degeneracy is exploding off the charts, not just in the United States. worldwide, We are a fallen civilization and it's only going to get worse. Yesterday, as the mass shooting unfolded in Tennessee at a school where darling little children and others were killed, I did not comment on the broadcast other than saying that the shooting had happened because I wanted to give it time to see what unfolded. but Scott, the producer, walked in right when it happened and he said: how much money you want to bet? This is a transgender person and that's because now, about 80% of the time, the school shooters are transgender and the media tries to cover it up. but we've got a bunch of the examples here of this happening and they already take quasi autistic people or mentally ill people and they hop them up on a bunch of wild hormones and then they wonder why they have the highest rates of suicide, one of the highest rates of crime out there. I don't hate transgender people. There are a lot of people that are transgender that are really nice, like Blair White, who's a very sweet, smart, good person, and I think she believes she's a woman and acts like a woman and if she wants to be a woman, she can be a woman. She doesn't want to go compete with women in sports, any of that stuff, but crazed men beating women in sports and women all hopped up on men's hormones now committing mass shootings. worldwide, We are a fallen civilization and it's only going to get worse.

I mean, women never commit mass shootings. In fact, it's never been heard of and now it's happening and these people are incredibly lost and it's really a demonic spirit where they feel led to go kill innocent little children.

And that's what happened yesterday and it's just hard to believe this stuff actually happens. That's even more unbelievable than them staging it. I mean, it's just the incompetence and the bureaucracy of some of these police departments. It's like with the tower shooter back in the 60s. Cops didn't wait, They charged up those stairs and they killed that guy while he shot at him. So the answer is: guns in school, especially Christian schools, are targets. Tucker Carlson predicted it on last Friday show- or was it Thursday show- where he said the transgenders are arming up and are probably going to start mass shooting people. And now they're announcing International Day of Rage on April 1st, where they're promising to have a violent uprising And the left, by the way, has been defending the attacker. The fight against the New World Order is now the top story in the world. The globalists are in deep trouble, but they're striking back with all their deep state operatives to shut down Infowars and other truth tellers like James O'Keefe, Tucker, Carlson and countless others. So please pray for us now more than ever. Enrich your life, empower your body and keep us on air. Please take action now. Infowarsstorecom Crashing through the lies and disinformation. it's Alex Jones coming to you. live from the front lines of the Infowars. Ladies and gentlemen, transgenderism is a Tabistock Institute, MI6, CIA creation to launch the transhumanist movement. Because if you'll accept a man being a woman, a woman being a man, if you'll accept two men having a baby when it's two women, or a man and a woman, if you will accept that you'll accept chimeric humanoids that are made out of three or four dads or two or three moms, or a mix of other people which they're now producing and making for decades in test tubes, you'll accept the entire globalist agenda. I do not hate people that are trans. I do not think that the average person that is living like that is a mass shooter or a bad person. That said, the entire movement is a synthetic creation for depopulation and to totally confuse society and break up the family. I do not think that the average person that is living like that is a mass shooter or a bad person. That said, the entire movement is a synthetic creation for depopulation and to totally confuse society and break up the family. and that's admitted. And the same leftist movement worldwide, funded by the big corporations that force feed this, are openly saying now they want to euthanize children without parental consent. So it's all about killing people. And if you can't sell killing babies out of the womb, well you just call it a transgender surgery and cut their breasts and their genitals off And then you get people caught up in this cult. caught up in this is your identity. this is why you're confused. take these hormones, do this and then, statistically, they are the most unhappy, suicide-prone people everywhere, anywhere. and we're told it's because you're not celebrating them, You're not accepting them, Why they went on this wonderful path at the public school or the system put them on, in some cases when they were two years old. take these hormones, do this and then, statistically, they are the most unhappy, suicide-prone people everywhere, anywhere. and we're told it's because you're not celebrating them, You're not accepting them, Why they went on this wonderful path at the public school or the system put them on, in some cases when they were two years old. now the trans cult says they know when a child's born at birth that they're trans. Well, it's not the fault of the system creating this nightmare. No, no, it's your fault for not worshipping it and rolling out a red carpet to it. So let's be clear, where I don't blame the average transgender person or say they're a bad person or judge them, the big think tanks, the intelligence agencies, the transhumanist, Julian Huxley combine is the group running this. their fingerprints are all over it, they're the authors of it, they admit they run the whole thing and it's the leading edge of the wedge to bring in transhumanists. humanoid, cyborg future that we're being told is the future and that the future isn't human by all the high priests of the globalist system. Now, that said, we're going to drill into what happened in Tennessee yesterday and the announcements all over Instagram, all over Twitter, all over Facebook, all over everywhere of saying, well, this is what you deserve. I've got the articles and pronounce right here: because you were mean to the transgenders in Tennessee's passing a law saying you can't sterilize little children. No, no, it's your fault for not worshipping it and rolling out a red carpet to it. So let's be clear, where I don't blame the average transgender person or say they're a bad person or judge them, the big think tanks, the intelligence agencies, the transhumanist, Julian Huxley combine is the group running this. their fingerprints are all over it, they're the authors of it, they admit they run the whole thing and it's the leading edge of the wedge to bring in transhumanists. humanoid, cyborg future that we're being told is the future and that the future isn't human by all the high priests of the globalist system. Now, that said, we're going to drill into what happened in Tennessee yesterday and the announcements all over Instagram, all over Twitter, all over Facebook, all over everywhere of saying, well, this is what you deserve. I've got the articles and pronounce right here: because you were mean to the transgenders in Tennessee's passing a law saying you can't sterilize little children. So, because there's this horrible abuse, the trans communities being weaponized by the deep state, by the Twittersphere, to now believe that violence is the answer. and you see it everywhere: them calling for the death of JK Rowling, for saying biological women are biological women and women's sports are women's sports. and a bunch of footage I didn't get to yesterday of Alex Stein being physically attacked at one of these cult events that he went to and a big activist who's very well-spoken and non-violent in New Zealand being physically attacked and barely making it out of their lives yesterday or I guess now two days ago. and if there's drag queen story time with little children being taken, we're half naked. they tell you we're going to kill you, we hope you die. So they are completely whacked out, many of them. and there's a pedophilic vein that runs through the center of the entire mess, because it's bigger than just wanting to sterilize children. it's about the spiritual energy in and around the destruction of a child's future and or a child's life. And this whole thing has a hunger to go out to Christian churches and Christian schools and murder Christians and murder children. So the trans cult is about murdering the future of a child, murdering their fertility, murdering their body parts, having giant fat men dance around naked in front of children- The giant, obscene, disgusting cult at the top with a bunch of brainwashed lemmings at the bottom, in the middle, including- and I've had members of parliament on from the UK about this a decade ago- the majority in the UK of transgender children are autistic And if you cover the drag queen times and the drag queen pedo times, like we have, you notice that the women look like that, are there bringing their children, look like they're mutants- And I'm not trying to be mean, they just all look like they're dying And their children are almost all completely And it's very sad but they're howling, they're barking at the moon, they're chirping, they're flappy-handsing- all the classic autistic stuff. There's even kids there with football helmets on. you know they're bumping their head into the ground and they're just rolling them in like here's where you're loved, here's where you're accepted. here's some fat men dressed like it and a clown, many of them convicted pedophiles. And this is just the army of evil rolling forward. you know they're bumping their head into the ground and they're just rolling them in like here's where you're loved, here's where you're accepted. here's some fat men dressed like it and a clown, many of them convicted pedophiles. And this is just the army of evil rolling forward. So just six, seven years ago, the big thing was just give us gay marriage and that's all we want. And now they attach to gay marriage and gay men. men dressed up like clowns, sexualizing children, scantily clad and cutting little girls' breasts off, little boys' penises off. I mean, this is a real cult. but they got the bandwagon going, you see. and now it's bestiality, now it's Satanism, now it's a culture that has the bottom falling out of it. And so there's all these calls here for the International Day of Rage of the Trans People, And men that think they're women and women that think they're men, out with sandwich boards, with images of rifles, saying trans rights or else. Now we played the clips many times. I'm not going to play them again. but the different universities rubbing their hands together. the university medical center is going. we make $40,000 cutting a girl's breast off. We make $30,000 cutting a little boy's penis off. It's our biggest growth industry. And they're convincing young children that they're another sex. they put them in a file, they put them on a fast track for destruction. and then now the numbers are exploding everywhere because there's all these alone confused people that play video games all day and are on a bunch of different psychotropic drugs, who don't have an identity because they're not outside hiking, they're not working in the fields, they're not learning things, they're not playing sports- We all know who's being typecast for this- and they take these really abused, hurt little children and they throw them in the deep fryer of the transgender cult and then they're pissed off. we make $40,000 cutting a girl's breast off. We make $30,000 cutting a little boy's penis off. It's our biggest growth industry.

Hey man, it's the Christian school I went to. that's why I'm so unhappy. They didn't recognize that I was really a man and so I'm going to go in there with my transgender manifesto. and we now have the comments from Audrey Hale, this totally confused young woman who went by Aiden, all dressed up in her man's outfit and doing what she thinks men do, Why men go and they mass shoot. And they're convincing young children that they're another sex. they put them in a file, they put them on a fast track for destruction. and then now the numbers are exploding everywhere because there's all these alone confused people that play video games all day and are on a bunch of different psychotropic drugs, who don't have an identity because they're not outside hiking, they're not working in the fields, they're not learning things, they're not playing sports- We all know who's being typecast for this- and they take these really abused, hurt little children and they throw them in the deep fryer of the transgender cult and then they're pissed off.

Never before had a woman do a mass shooting. have we Saying: this is the end of my life? this is not a joke. And this person thought the way to die is to go kill little kids. I want to tell you first, because you are the most beautiful person I've ever seen and known my whole life. My family doesn't know what I'm about to do. One day this will make more sense. I've left more than enough evidence behind, but something bad is about to happen And as they hype the mass shootings, they will increase and they will get worse. because mentally ill people are now taught: you don't just become transgender, you go out and you shoot and you kill people. And now the majority of mass shooters that are technically the totally senseless type is the FBI. averages in gang shootings that are at schools then says: well, half of them are black on black or black on Hispanic or Hispanic on Hispanic. But if you take those out, that are gang shootings and you just have raw going to school, shoot a bunch of kids. this is it, And they fight to hide that. So again, please take action. Go to mfoolworthstorecom today And I thank you. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, It's Alex Jones, From the front lines of the information war. It's Alex Jones. The stated goal of the mega corporations and the giant private foundations that control them is ending the human family as we know it and making us atomized, dependent corporate products that they own. They want to sell us on accepting humanoids, human animal, cross species, all this garbage everywhere that they've been developing in the dark and they're now rolling out, And the first thing to destabilize us was to break up the family, demonize the role of men, attack masculinity, attack true femininity and then bring forward the transgender cult who again are unhappy and depressed and committing suicide because they're in the jaws of this meat grinder. And then the system goes: look, you're unhappy because they're not accepting you. And the more we try to accept, the more we feed our children into this meat grinder. why, the more we've got to do, the more we've got to comply, the more we've got to jump through hoops, Because, after all, you want these people to be happy, don't you? The great society and the letters are public. you got guts. you got a brain. you know. And all the trans talk about violence. if you keep killing us and making us commit suicide because you don't accept us when we're like, you can do whatever you want, paint your hair however you want, have sex with whoever you want, as long as they're a consenting adult. You think I'm actually running around thinking about trans people all day or hating them? No, I'm not. I'm a live and let live guy. But in the roaring 20s in Germany they had the transgender movement that spread worldwide from there. That picked up later in the 60s by British intelligence And it is the hallmark of a society before it collapses. And all the trans talk about violence. if you keep killing us and making us commit suicide because you don't accept us when we're like, you can do whatever you want, paint your hair however you want, have sex with whoever you want, as long as they're a consenting adult. You think I'm actually running around thinking about trans people all day or hating them? No, I'm not. I'm a live and let live guy. But in the roaring 20s in Germany they had the transgender movement that spread worldwide from there. That picked up later in the 60s by British intelligence And it is the hallmark of a society before it collapses. And the system knows this, so they've accelerated it. In the 60s and 70s they did the famous rat studies, where they would have contained cities of rats and give them all the food and all the water they wanted And within three generations, the males become trans and the females become the bosses And then, within another generation, they all just start eating each other or committing suicide And then, within about eight generations, there are no rats left. We've done whole shows on that. That is the last thing that needs to happen And we need to upfront say we do not want that. People are going to want to avenge these dead kids and other Christians. Christians are being targeted, But there's a time to turn the other cheek And the trans cult minions and gremlins of the system should not be harmed. They should be arrested if they hurt children or get caught doing pedophilia or any of that. We should pass laws. They can't target children, But we do not need anybody to go attack one of these events or attack any transgender person. And let me go further. I'm not calling for violence, But if you want to know who does all this and who created all this, the history of it's on record. So I want to target those groups by exposing them and call for legal action against them: The big hospitals that push these surgeries, the Tabestock Institute, all the different leftist groups, Hollywood, Disney, that are funding it. withdraw your money from these people. You're going to work for them now. I mean, it's so fantastical and it just shows there is no bridle on what these people do now. It is just. this alone is bigger news than the shooting. The shooting is terrible. The transgender story is integral to the whole new world or takeover. It's all very important, But this tells you where the future is going- And we knew it a long time ago. We talked about it- where there's all these devices in your house controlling your thermostat, controlling you, watching everything you do, carbon taxes reporting back on you, the home assistants watching and listening to you, including a little robot vacuum cleaner. They're not selling you that vacuum cleaner at cost because they like you. They're selling it to you because the data they sell off of it is going to make them 10 times what the purchase of the vacuum cleaner made Like. This isn't about: oh, let's ban TikTok because they spy on us and jump in your devices. It's that the Chinese are competing with what the globalists are doing. I say: ban it all. But let's get back to Tucker Carlson. Here's Tucker Carlson being criticized last week, on March 24th, all over Rolling Stone, you name it, This one's LGBTQ nation. Tucker Carlson is afraid gun-toting trans people will start political violence. And then a few days later, three days later, his prophecy comes true. So here's Tucker from Friday. and then it happens on Monday. Here's part of the report. This seems like an incitement, and it's everywhere. Oh, the LGBTQ XYZ is under attack. Oh, they're mass shooting us. None of it's true. Well, let's just go out and kill some little kids in an elementary school, That'll fix it. And then you look at the last few shootings at LBGT XYZ events and it was transgender people- I showed you the articles earlier- who were mad at their boyfriend or girlfriend or something, And they're just whacked out on psychotropics and Xanax and hormones. And you look at them. you know green hair all wild out And you're like this is what you do to people, This is what you offer, This is your wonderful new religion for us to all bow down to. And you want our guns. And I've talked to some of the big gun shops here in town that I visit, like the local shooting ranges, and they tell me the majority of their customers now are liberals, since Trump preparing for civil war. Get off me, Get off me, Get off me. And they feel entitled to be violent. You guys should be ashamed of yourself, And I've got the articles right here with major trans organizations saying: well, you know, the killer's a victim too, Because you were mean to him- her. So let's go to Alex Stein now to talk about this. Couldn't be a more timely time to have him on. We've got Minnesota lawmakers advanced transgender reps legislation that could strip custody from parents who don't support child's transition. Canada's trying to take kids from parents that don't want them to commit suicide. I mean, this is a death cult. I'm wondering how much more obvious it's got to get Alex Stein. thank you for joining us. Love the set, Love what he does, Love the fact that he's just reaching more and more people. Alex, good to have you here with us. Well, it's a pleasure. but let me talk about the real elephant in the room, Alex, that nobody's talking about. So we see levels of autism today from an MMR vaccine, measles, mumps, rubella, that the pharmaceutical companies will even say that correlation does not equal causation, when the alarming rates of autism. And now, if you actually look, and you actually look at the mental health studies, a lot of these people that identify as non-binary or transgender are high functioning autists. You'll see now in the media they're talking about Aubrey Hale is a high functioning autist. So that is the crux of this problem is that we're basically enabling people that are actually mentally challenged. It's even stronger than gender dysphoria. They're actually suffering from autism And that is why this society is getting so bad, because the increased rate of autism is going to only increase the rate of transgenderism.

They're actually suffering from autism And that is why this society is getting so bad, because the increased rate of autism is going to only increase the rate of transgenderism. You just hit the nail on the board. a decade ago I had a liberal member of parliament on who found over half the kids they were having transition were autistic. They know, once you get an autistic kid to obsess on something and give them attention, when they're like six or seven or even younger, they then tell them: you're a boy, you're a girl, they're really the other. That becomes their identity. I'm just sad that a poll that these politicians are trying to ruin America put a stain on America by potentially arresting Donald Trump for a misdemeanor crime And the problem is that puts a stain on the whole entire country, Alex, That makes us look bad. So we're shooting ourselves in the foot And I don't know we're going to keep shooting ourselves in the foot until we run out of metaphorical bullets. at this point I want to talk about a young turds clip. when we come back. It's up on Infowarscom Just days before the shooting in Tennessee. he told trans people get guns because the right wing is coming to kill you And we're not killing any of these people. And I mean the point is, is that they're literally being told they're under attack. So they come out, attack us. It's just, it's so sad And you know people are getting mad at me. They want me to press charges out. I'll be a little bit of a hypocrite here, but it's not. I'll explain why I'm saying it. I don't like guns. I would ban assault weapons in a second. We can go on and on about the gun control that we need in this country, And I always tell people: don't get guns, it'll make you less safe. I'm gonna make you an exception here for trans people. They are actually in danger. They have had hundreds of laws passed against them. They have right wing media ginning up fear against them- 24: seven. They are targeted more than any other group in America And if anyone should get guns, it should be trans Americans. saying, oh yeah, the US was founded on corruption. No, the free nations were not founded on corruption, They were founded as anti-NWO and they got infiltrated. But anyway, the thing I wanted to talk about was when I was on hold for Owen Schroyer's war room yesterday. he said to call in about three things. they're all pointing in the same direction and that's NWO takeover of society, And they were the trans agenda and the shooting and Joe Biden's bumbling and fumbling. As far as the trans agenda, leading to the decline of society, it's very interesting that one very intelligent, very knowledgeable researcher, Dr Camille Paglia, who herself is transgender but on transitions, points out that societies that allow this invariably in history just collapse soon afterwards. As far as the shooting goes, there's a lot of gaslighting going on because if one reads the magnum opus on the subject, Dr John R Lott Jr's More Guns, Less Crime- turns out that there is not one single case in history where increased gun control has led to decreased crime and in the vast majority of cases it's led to increased crime. Yeah, you're absolutely right, Johnny. This is evidenced even by the fact that the Democrat states that are really tough on gun control have really high crime rates. but places like Bolsonaro legalises, gives more guns to his people and the crime goes down. it is amazing experience: pure medica, bollum and b12 for yourself and fund the second america revolution against the tyrants at info wars store dot com in force live dot com. or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine. you're listening to the alex jones show live from the info wars dot com studios. you're listening to the alex jones show there. ain't nothing to listen to me, baby. well, jessica yoni is a transgender woman and is powerful lgbtq two s i a plus activists. she currently uh ran for miss bc and plans to run again 2020. lives in canada. she believes strongly in human rights and equality. she also is a well-known tech blogger and is on her 10th year running trusted nerd dot com, and so, um, it's, it's good to have you on with us. i know you're scheduled, or scheduled, for you to be on the war room with. she also is a well-known tech blogger and is on her 10th year running trusted nerd dot com, and so, um, it's, it's good to have you on with us. i know you're scheduled, or scheduled, for you to be on the war room with. i want shroyer today. uh, tell us, tell us, uh, a little bit about yourself- and i mean you're all over the news- what your main mission is. yeah, so my main mission is essentially human rights and lgbtq equality. um, like, i am a transgender woman and i was really seeking, uh, gender firming care services. when it was so, what things like when it comes to waxing, facials, pedicures, manicures, head massage, the whole nine yards- and i was pretty distraught to see the level of discrimination that is out there when it comes to people in the lgbtq trying to receive gender firming care services. it's, it's horrible and i did not feel right to just let this go. um, you know when, when they are, when these providers are willing to do services on someone who is a male and not a transgender, but an actual male, but they're unwilling to do it on a transgender woman or even a transgender, uh, male, um, that just i don't understand. that, okay, can i bring, because i've seen articles in the uk where the national health service, where a nurse, doesn't want to do a pap smear, uh, on a uh person calling themselves transgender. uh, tell us, tell us, uh, a little bit about yourself- and i mean you're all over the news- what your main mission is. yeah, so my main mission is essentially human rights and lgbtq equality. um, like, i am a transgender woman and i was really seeking, uh, gender firming care services. when it was so, what things like when it comes to waxing, facials, pedicures, manicures, head massage, the whole nine yards- and i was pretty distraught to see the level of discrimination that is out there when it comes to people in the lgbtq trying to receive gender firming care services. it's, it's horrible and i did not feel right to just let this go. um, you know when, when they are, when these providers are willing to do services on someone who is a male and not a transgender, but an actual male, but they're unwilling to do it on a transgender woman or even a transgender, uh, male, um, that just i don't understand. that, okay, can i bring, because i've seen articles in the uk where the national health service, where a nurse, doesn't want to do a pap smear, uh, on a uh person calling themselves transgender. i'm not a libertarian. somebody wants to say they're a woman, whatever, but, but, but what about? what about when there's not a, a cervix? yeah, so my main mission is essentially human rights and lgbtq equality. um, like, i am a transgender woman and i was really seeking, uh, gender firming care services. when it was so, what things like when it comes to waxing, facials, pedicures, manicures, head massage, the whole nine yards- and i was pretty distraught to see the level of discrimination that is out there when it comes to people in the lgbtq trying to receive gender firming care services. it's, it's horrible and i did not feel right to just let this go. um, you know when, when they are, when these providers are willing to do services on someone who is a male and not a transgender, but an actual male, but they're unwilling to do it on a transgender woman or even a transgender, uh, male, um, that just i don't understand. that, okay, can i bring, because i've seen articles in the uk where the national health service, where a nurse, doesn't want to do a pap smear, uh, on a uh person calling themselves transgender. i'm not a libertarian. somebody wants to say they're a woman, whatever, but, but, but what about? what about when there's not a, a cervix? uh, that's like saying, you know, give me a root canal, but i don't have any teeth? uh, that's like saying, you know, give me a root canal, but i don't have any teeth? yeah it, it's. it's different, um, it's different when it comes to things like, um, like gynecology, like myself- it's a little bit embarrassing, but i do have a gynecologist, um, i have been checked um. but but when it comes to like but when it comes to people that are that do not exactly need that service- for example, um cervical exams on on rather a biological man that doesn't need that- then yeah, that that i totally understand. uh, the refusal service when it comes to health, like a female doesn't need, like a biological female doesn't need to go in and get a prostate exam unless she's intersex and or has some sort of, some sort of um abnormality happening there. let me ask you this: why do you think all this transgenderism is so hot? why is it just everywhere? every children show, every tv program, every, it's just everywhere. you just it's everywhere. i think it's because we live in a new day and age. i couldn't handle it, uh, but i was good enough to get hurt real bad every game, but i was. i'm not a tough guy, but it was still weird to pull my clothes off and you know, and get naked around guys and the coaches would walk through and once a year they'd come in and do a test to make sure i didn't have a hernia, and you know what. the coach would stick his finger you know where, or or the, uh, the doctor would, and i didn't like that. and and my daughters are even more squeamish and stuff, and you know i have three daughters and sometimes i walk by their room and one of them's, you know, half naked and they freak out, oh dad. and slam the door like, like chris qualmo said a few years ago. he said like 12 year old girl should be ready to have a transgender man as a woman in the shower and if they see his genitals they shouldn't get upset. i don't think that's reasonable. i do um actually, because you know, there people want to start segregating um, uh, segregating sex and, from from what i see, i don't think the average women particularly want to be around a bunch of about a round, a bunch of swans. yes and no, yes and no. i i i do agree where, i do agree where you're getting out here. we're being used by god. you're being used by god. this is providence. so i salute you and i thank you for all you've done from the bottom of my heart. you're listening to the alex jones show. jessica yanov is a transgender from canada, and we only got this segment, maybe one more, so we got to move quickly here. i want to break this down. um, we have photos, uh, here in articles, with you, um, you know, at these events- or what are these events where? where you're in bathrooms and i've got some of the tweets here and some of the things, uh, that you say here. what is this activism? um, i kind of have my suspicions on who it is, but i'm not going to say exactly who, um, because i can't but um, but no, i didn't write any of that, sure, sure, what did you mean earlier by you can't discriminate by age? what does that mean? well, what? what i mean by that is like: oh, i'm going to give an example. last night, my mom tried to book me for a facial and what happened with that is the. the person on the other side, uh, then asked her: how old is your transgender daughter? uh, to which she replied 32, and then, um, both of us were refused service, not only um and on, on several protected grounds actually- and this is going to go before the tribunal- but um, but essentially, essentially on family status, gender identity, expression, sex, um, and what's the? and also age as well. so i'm just asking the question: if you're a woman, because i'm not big into, i might have had one pedicure, one manicure in my life, and i've, and i've been on a cruise before my ex-wife and they said, hey, you want his and hers facials. they did this facial, put cream on my face and did all this. and also age as well. so i'm just asking the question: if you're a woman, because i'm not big into, i might have had one pedicure, one manicure in my life, and i've, and i've been on a cruise before my ex-wife and they said, hey, you want his and hers facials. they did this facial, put cream on my face and did all this. i mean, they weren't asking man or woman, they just said: you want a facial. so how does i don't even get how they're like. you're on the line, i'm a transgender, i'm getting a facial and they're like: no, i mean well, exactly the the. the problem, the problem that we have where i reside is there's quite um quite racialized cultural groups here that do not believe in transgenderism and they believe that they have the right, um, they believe that they have the right to review service on any basis that they want, including that, oh, let me guess, because most of- i mean, like i'd say, 70% of the nails and facial stuff is it? is it vietnamese or asians? uh, it's kind of a mix, it's like. like, the way i explained it to the tribunal is, when you deal with things like waxing, it's usually vietnamese or east indian, um, or taiwanese. so i'm just asking the question: if you're a woman, because i'm not big into, i might have had one pedicure, one manicure in my life, and i've, and i've been on a cruise before my ex-wife and they said, hey, you want his and hers facials. they did this facial, put cream on my face and did all this. i mean, they weren't asking man or woman, they just said: you want a facial. so how does i don't even get how they're like. you're on the line, i'm a transgender, i'm getting a facial and they're like: no, i mean well, exactly the the. the problem, the problem that we have where i reside is there's quite um quite racialized cultural groups here that do not believe in transgenderism and they believe that they have the right, um, they believe that they have the right to review service on any basis that they want, including that, oh, let me guess, because most of- i mean, like i'd say, 70% of the nails and facial stuff is it? is it vietnamese or asians? uh, it's kind of a mix, it's like. like, the way i explained it to the tribunal is, when you deal with things like waxing, it's usually vietnamese or east indian, um, or taiwanese. it's, you know, in their culture they're not, or any culture. is it vietnamese or asians? uh, it's kind of a mix, it's like. like, the way i explained it to the tribunal is, when you deal with things like waxing, it's usually vietnamese or east indian, um, or taiwanese. it's, you know, in their culture they're not, or any culture. you're not supposed to touch anybody's. if you're a woman, you're not supposed to touch another man's penis unless it's your husband. i know, but since when do we have a penis on our forehead? so so i don't understand. why would we want to make a woman? i'm just asking why we want to make a woman if it's her religious or cultural thing that maybe she's a bit, has been with one man in her life, i mean most, even wild women i've known, you know right away, aren't just ready to jump in the sack, well then, how do you think a woman is ready to touch her? uh, it's kind of a mix, it's like. like, the way i explained it to the tribunal is, when you deal with things like waxing, it's usually vietnamese or east indian, um, or taiwanese. it's, you know, in their culture they're not, or any culture. you're not supposed to touch anybody's. if you're a woman, you're not supposed to touch another man's penis unless it's your husband. i know, but since when do we have a penis on our forehead? so so i don't understand. why would we want to make a woman? i'm just asking why we want to make a woman if it's her religious or cultural thing that maybe she's a bit, has been with one man in her life, i mean most, even wild women i've known, you know right away, aren't just ready to jump in the sack, well then, how do you think a woman is ready to touch her? i just don't get that. but when they try to make other people comport to what they want, like like almost all the the sprinting, almost all the power lifting, from australia to the us, to canada's, being won by biological men who have twice the size bones, twice the muscle, on average, they even have their genitals, so they have testosterone. well it men, biological men, are going to win every competition in the world now, rendering women's sports obsolete, whether it's basketball or football or hockey, it'll be all biological men- nice, pretty hair, nice fingernails, but it'll be. it'll be biological men, and women will be obsolete in sports. is that, is that inclusive? no, and and and that's actually where i i agree with you when it comes, when it comes to things such as sporting competitions and such- and i had, i had quite a um, i had quite a discussion about this with, uh, the good friend of mine, um, named lin, um, especially in regards to the article you just pulled up, um, i don't agree with um. i i don't agree with transgender, um, transgender identifying individuals going into sports and winning competitions when they still have a heavy, heavy, heavy level of testosterone. and i'm gonna give you an example here: uh, before i transitioned, i had quite a, uh, quite a high testosterone level, um, and then i started hormone replacement therapy. and when you start hormone replacement therapy, those, those pills, essentially, essentially, eliminate your testosterone. like what i had, as was a level of 14, i now have a level of 1.2, uh, for example, on my testosterone. so what i do believe is that these, these individuals can compete if their testosterone levels are below, uh, below a certain number, that being like below four or well above the hell. i i don't agree with transgender, um, transgender identifying individuals going into sports and winning competitions when they still have a heavy, heavy, heavy level of testosterone. and i'm gonna give you an example here: uh, before i transitioned, i had quite a, uh, quite a high testosterone level, um, and then i started hormone replacement therapy. and when you start hormone replacement therapy, those, those pills, essentially, essentially, eliminate your testosterone. like what i had, as was a level of 14, i now have a level of 1.2, uh, for example, on my testosterone. so what i do believe is that these, these individuals can compete if their testosterone levels are below, uh, below a certain number, that being like below four or well above the hell. but i don't, i don't agree, i don't agree with um, i don't agree with transgender females pumping themselves up with testosterone to even get above what, um, what a biological male would, because that gets into risky territory. i've heard of cases where people are breaking, breaking necks, breaking bones, breaking everything. well, sir, i'll say this, i'll say this: humans change their environment. we build our own structures, we change ourselves. that's a human trait. you've won a lot of battles and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue. we're going to keep fighting in the info war and even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty. thank you, sir, for calling. you're listening to the alex jones show defending the republic from enemies, foreign and domestic. it's alex jones. jessica yana is a transgender, male to female, and he's coming on the show. so i'm being nice here. but we've got a esthetician here, that's. it's also trained to be a producer doing a great job. becca, and she was explaining that what you're trained to do, she says she's done. what, what's your take on that? you know, uh, you know. one thing i want to say about the post millennial is, um, it's to my understanding that the, that the council, the, the, the owner of the law firm that is counsel to the respondents, own supposed millennialcom. they have published the found material articles about me day in and day out. but i, i really want, i really want to get to something important here, because i do believe that this is important. you know, going back to the refusal of service, you know they, they're essentially saying that you know we won't do service on a man or transgender. but transgender also means, uh, female to male. i have a friend, her name, his name is um, is taylor, and he, you know he, he's female to male. so what's essentially how happening here is they are also refusing service on transgender males, that being ones that also have 100 percent. Well, let me raise this. you know, uh, you know. one thing i want to say about the post millennial is, um, it's to my understanding that the, that the council, the, the, the owner of the law firm that is counsel to the respondents, own supposed millennialcom. they have published the found material articles about me day in and day out. but i, i really want, i really want to get to something important here, because i do believe that this is important. you know, going back to the refusal of service, you know they, they're essentially saying that you know we won't do service on a man or transgender. but transgender also means, uh, female to male. i have a friend, her name, his name is um, is taylor, and he, you know he, he's female to male. so what's essentially how happening here is they are also refusing service on transgender males, that being ones that also have 100 percent. Well, let me raise this. you have record levels of autism and record levels of suicide, mental illness and transgendered. they have published the found material articles about me day in and day out. but i, i really want, i really want to get to something important here, because i do believe that this is important. you know, going back to the refusal of service, you know they, they're essentially saying that you know we won't do service on a man or transgender. but transgender also means, uh, female to male. i have a friend, her name, his name is um, is taylor, and he, you know he, he's female to male. so what's essentially how happening here is they are also refusing service on transgender males, that being ones that also have 100 percent. Well, let me raise this. you have record levels of autism and record levels of suicide, mental illness and transgendered. a lot of people don't want to deal with a mental health issue. What do you mean? you know, going back to the refusal of service, you know they, they're essentially saying that you know we won't do service on a man or transgender. but transgender also means, uh, female to male. i have a friend, her name, his name is um, is taylor, and he, you know he, he's female to male. so what's essentially how happening here is they are also refusing service on transgender males, that being ones that also have 100 percent.

What do you mean? Well, you're, you're, you're actually well spoken and and holding your own, but i mean a lot of times you see a crazy transgender bank robber or the men. i mean the statistics are there that there are a lot of autistic people and stuff that that uh end up getting tricked when they're young to being- quote other sex. so what's essentially how happening here is they are also refusing service on transgender males, that being ones that also have 100 percent.

I think. the first one was cancelled and then they- she was trying to organize another one at the Al Anderson Memorial pool in Langley, British Columbia, Canada. the promotional material for the event states parents and or caregivers are not permitted in the event. it's important to state from the outset that Jessica you need denies this story and denies that she was behind the conversations mentioned in this article, just as she denied that she was behind the tweets when Alex was interviewing her earlier. very easy get out clause, that isn't. it says a young woman has come forward with with serious allegations of abuse against Jonathan. Jessica you need. you need. the male to female transgender has recently risen to infamy for the human rights tribunal suits. she's taken out in 16 estitians declining to perform waxing services on her male genitals. we talked about that earlier, but now, 20 year old Jessica Rumpel of Samanish, Washington State has disclosed details to the post millennial of her encounters with Jessica you need. guess what her encounters were with Jessica you need? well, Rumpel was just 14 years old at the time of the interactions, just about to turn 15, and if you were pull up this article, you can see the actual conversations, again denied by Jessica you need. so Yannive obviously has some weird fetish obsession with female sanitary products. the alleged victim says Yannive always told me he uses pads and wants to go into the ladies bathroom. as we saw with the tweets, that seems to be a constant obsession, but of course they're fake too. apparently Yannive asked me how to go into the ladies bathroom without being caught and then how to be in the bathroom if there's a lot of women or girls and, as we saw before, there are selfies that this Jessica Yannive individuals has took in female changing rooms. so the conversation continues and it's basically Jessica Yannive asking if she- with male genitalia, of course- can get changed in front of young women and girls in a female locker room. according to Rumpel, the alleged victim, Yannive, did not identify as transgender at any point during their interactions. now, of course, if you look at the screenshots of that chat now, it shows Jessica Yannive locking or presenting as a female, because of course, that's what happens on Facebook. even though the conversations old- several years old, in fact, I think five years old- the profile picture is still going to show up as the current profile picture, so that's why it does that. the victim continued she believed Yannive simply had a fetish for bathrooms, pads and girls clothing, as Yannive would also be in sending Rumpel worrying messages, including photos of himself in girls jeans, asking for comments and compliments from the then 15 year old. so, as you can see there the Jessica Yannive is sending pictures of herself in what she claims are women's jeans and asking if they look okay. so I salute you and I thank you for all you've done from the bottom of my heart. info wars- the most banned network in the world. you're listening to the Alex Jones show, news analysis reports. it's the Alex Jones show and now your host, Paul Joseph Watson. we are back. Jessica, you need the transgender activists. who is basically at the forefront of having 15 female beauticians, investigator by the Canadian human rights tribunal refusing to wax her testicles through this allegation of a Facebook conversation with a then 14 year old girl who claimed- and these messages, if true, prove it again- it's being denied by. you need that the messages are true, but if they are, then it proves obvious child grooming. of course you need was on the show earlier, denied all this and will be on the show again, I believe, in the war room, in the next hour. but this really got prominent over the past few days because the British comedian Ricky Gervais, who is a free speech advocate, waited into the debate and there's actually a funny tweet which I tweeted earlier, which was a daily caller article headlined: Ricky Gervais doesn't think women should be forced to wax testicles. of course you need was on the show earlier, denied all this and will be on the show again, I believe, in the war room, in the next hour. but this really got prominent over the past few days because the British comedian Ricky Gervais, who is a free speech advocate, waited into the debate and there's actually a funny tweet which I tweeted earlier, which was a daily caller article headlined: Ricky Gervais doesn't think women should be forced to wax testicles. and then one of the responses below that tweet was from somebody who said the moment that Ricky Gervais became alt right. that's right, because if you don't think women should be forced to wax men's testicles, that means you're not see. now that's how much the overton window is shifted in clown world newsbusters reports. Ricky Gervais called transphobe for defending women refusing to wax trans woman's penis. warning course language throughout. again, I have to read this ahead of actually saying it. British comedian Ricky Gervais has been called transphobic over defending women refusing to wax trans women in Canada because they're uncomfortable dealing with their clients very male genitalia. Gervais defended the spa workers, saying that it's- quote- real feminism for women to choose who to wax or not. that's right, because if you don't think women should be forced to wax men's testicles, that means you're not see. now that's how much the overton window is shifted in clown world newsbusters reports.

British comedian Ricky Gervais has been called transphobic over defending women refusing to wax trans women in Canada because they're uncomfortable dealing with their clients very male genitalia. Gervais defended the spa workers, saying that it's- quote- real feminism for women to choose who to wax or not. but internet users aren't having it. on Sunday, Gervais weighed in and one of the most most stupidly welk issues to crop up in recent memory in Canada, demonstrating himself as a celebrity that isn't completely devoid of common sense, he put out a controversial tweet which said: quote: how did we get to the point where women are having to fight for the right to choose whether they wax some big old hairy cock and balls or not? is it not human rights? but internet users aren't having it. on Sunday, Gervais weighed in and one of the most most stupidly welk issues to crop up in recent memory in Canada, demonstrating himself as a celebrity that isn't completely devoid of common sense, he put out a controversial tweet which said: quote: how did we get to the point where women are having to fight for the right to choose whether they wax some big old hairy cock and balls or not? is it not human rights? have your meat and two veg polished. and, of course, he was immediately attacked. Twitter warriors clamored against Gervais as posting its language like that that has threatened trans people and that it contributes to the larger hashtag war on women. again, there are feminists, quite radical feminists, who are called transphobes, who are called terfs, who have been excluded from public conversations, who have been banned from social media platforms for daring to suggest that men with their testicles hanging out shouldn't be allowed into female locker rooms. one respondent said this was LGBTQ activist. Amy Martin quote: Ricky Gervais is a transphobic, barely disguised as his bigotry. is feminism?

Amy Martin quote: Ricky Gervais is a transphobic, barely disguised as his bigotry. is feminism? real feminism includes all women, including trans women. so they're literally defending a man who wants to force women to shave his testicles. that's feminism in 2019. in clown world, Gervais replied: surely real feminism also covers a woman's right not to have to wax someone's knob and bollocks if they don't want to. and it went on from there. again, we've got these new messages now that post millenials posted which seem to indicate that this is part of a child grooming operation. we're going to go to it right now. this is Lindsay Shepherd, free speech activist, on why she was banned by Twitter. here it is: Hi everyone, I have been permanently banned from Twitter and, yes, I did file an appeal, but it was quickly denied. you may have watched the video that I made last night where I talk about the same topic- my Twitter ban- but I had to take it down and give another shot because I had to make some corrections in order to comply with a publication ban. I was banned from Twitter for responding to a couple of tweets that an individual that I will only refer to you as JY made about me. so JY has a very complicated backstory that is getting more and more disjointed, so all I'm going to say here is that JY purports to be a transgender woman, and JY is someone that lives in the same province that I do, which is why I probably feel a little more invested in this issue than other people who don't live in this province. there are leaked Facebook message screenshots where JY is trying to get advice on how to approach preteen girls in the female washrooms, and he says things like: can you see tampon strings hanging out of a girl's pussy? what do girls do in the bathroom? stall white pussy and change panty liner. oh, I'm going on the BC fairies next week and lots of 10 year old girls go on field trips on the ferry. and then I reply and I say: at least I have a uterus, you ugly fat man. I deleted the tweets in the morning when I woke up, but was permanently suspended by the afternoon. some people have said that I should have never engaged with JY online. I shouldn't have sunk to his level. but the thing is, this is someone who straight up ruins people's lives, and I'm not talking about the Twitter bans, I'm talking about really ruining people's lives. and the reason I think the JY situation is so important is because it proves trans people are untouchable. JY is allowed to make crude and disgusting comments and misogynistic comments, but when I want to talk back to him, stand up for myself, defend myself, I'm silenced and kicked off of the platform permanently, but JY receives no punishment and remains on the platform. the moral of the story is: you can't stand up for yourself against a trans person. one more evidence of this: watch the video I made called did I harass a trans person? it's I tell the story of a fellow grad student who made a complaint against me at my university and he was a trans individual who would always try to instigate conflict with me, and he made a complaint saying I was the problem. and the reason I think the JY situation is so important is because it proves trans people are untouchable.

We are back and we've stopped talking about Jessica you need, which most of you will be delighted about. A few months ago on Twitter, I put in my Twitter bio he him as my preferred pronouns as a joke. I removed them later, but I put them in for a few weeks as a joke. Now we have this headline out of the Daily Caller: These 2020 Democrats have their preferred gender pronouns in their Twitter bios. Of course, there are no transgender Democrat 2020 presidential candidates, so far at least, or any who have identified as transgender. But three prominent Democratic presidential candidates have their preferred gender pronouns in their Twitter bios. Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro's bio declares he him L. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's bio says he him. That's literally what I did as a joke. how Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York City, has it. This is going on. They're following a script. Here's Will Johnson in Austin, Texas, last night.

Well, they just dress them up like clowns so their identities are protected, and then call the clown. call the clown a woman. These are men in disguise as doing this and they've launched a full out assault and they're following a script. You'll see the same report in Australia that you see it in the United States or England or Germany on the same day, and they're all networking and operating in unison and it's all funded by the big universities, funded by the big art displays, funded by taxpayers. They're taken into schools- remember in Denver- and the elementary, and the parents aren't told that a drag queen, a transvestite, a man is coming to speak with their children on career day until second, third, fourth, fifth graders, that they should grow up and work in adult entertainment, and then the children sit on their laps, unannounced appearance, and then the man dresses a woman, sits on a table and then moves across the table and spreads their legs to the children and we're putting together a compilation, since this broke this morning, of them doing these exact moves. The next move is to ride them horsey. ride them horsey. and it's the exact same move. They sit on the table, they spread their legs like it's a woman inviting a man to come in and have sex with them, and it's a ritual. they have to bathe you in corruption. so the new thing is sex with animals, sex with snakes, sex with rodents, torturing animals- and sex with bugs, centipedes, spiders, spiders, and so there's a giant new massive rollout hitting every channel. just, it's everywhere. today, Al Jazeera says not wanting to eat insects is racist. Texas Art Museum encourages children to eat bugs. Cheshire Home Invasion Killer tells podcasts he's transgendered. he's getting his transgender in prison. it's all cute, it's all funny. hey, you get those houses easier sometimes. you know the big bad wolf. so the new thing is sex with animals, sex with snakes, sex with rodents, torturing animals- and sex with bugs, centipedes, spiders, spiders, and so there's a giant new massive rollout hitting every channel. just, it's everywhere. today, Al Jazeera says not wanting to eat insects is racist.

and if you crouch down into this on a business here, so your bum sticking out, if you're taking this all in and then you just move your bum up and down like that and that's twerking. a lot of the core values of being a drag queen- love, acceptance, joy, laughter, self-expression- are values that we want to instill in our kids. so i think it's really important that we bring this program and the joy of just spreading love. all these kids commit suicide at record rates. it's our fault, not the parents, not the sick ones and everywhere else it's called pedophilia. but when it's done institutionally and they can get away with people dressed up like demon clowns with your children, pull up tranny time in the new york schools. this is put out in new york times like it's wonderful and it's the biggest scary looking group of weirdo potbellied men. looks like a bunch of denise hashtards running around with you clown makeup on, just hopping around rubbing their giant bellies in front of children, and you're like what alternate universe is this? what planet did i wake up in? all right, now let's play this short clip of the little boy that just got a reprieve by the governor to don't have his testicles chopped off: james younger, here he is. but the governor got involved and that judge ran for the hills to see. they're like, hey, this one will get away, but if you make too much of attention to make this boy a martyr, we're not gonna get to millions. let him go, we're gonna get all those and we'll get him later, don't worry. and they know the boys are gonna rebel later when their testicles are chopped off and so they drug them up real good, make sure they commit suicide by about 18. and the mission's completed. and it's done so delicately, it's so carefully, my pretty, because all of this must be done very in PR voice, very delicately, because you don't want your patient to wake up on the operating table while we take their soul and everything they ever were and ever would be with us forever. because chopping their penises and testicles off is just a way to freak them out and screw them up so we can put them under psychiatric care and slowly depress them and use them as a slave until they finally die beautifully and the arms of satan forever. oh, it's so, labor. you see, i show you their real soul, just the surface. it's much worse beneath there. i really don't want to tune into it to you. they're just getting us ready for it and ganging up on us and taking our free speech. i have stacks of news where they're shutting down people's free speech. will johnson went down and to an elementary school yesterday. in fact, see if i meant to call will johnson last night. this morning i was watching firepower last night with he and uh tom papper and i just didn't get around to it. see if you can get johnson in here, um to co-host with myself and uh constitutional lawyer, famous lawyer norm pass can be a studio fourth hour, see, because we're already going to be talking about all these serial killers and people who now call themselves transgender. maybe get him on the last 30 minutes with uh paddus here with us. he can do that. but then there's all this other news. i mean there's just stacks of incredible stuff. i love how they say what they are, so we call them that. you're a man in war paint dressed up like a woman showing your genitals. little girls, they used to have a name for that. that happened in the park. he'd served 10 years in prison, but now, oh, it's art. look at this guy: chess jar, home invasion killer tells podcast host he's transgender in prison now. i guess he'll get his weenie and stuff cut off- the taxpayer expense- other sick ritual. but let's go to your phone calls right now. let's go to jacob and then we'll go to other callers: jacob, jacob in south carolina, thanks for holding her on the air. hi, alex and hyunee. uh, i want to say god bless guys for everything you've done on your show and and what you're doing for america. well, god bless you, brother, you've been following you since 2000. hey, do me a favor. if you've got your phone away from your face or something muffling it, can you talk right into your phone? yeah, can you hear me better here? yes, i can go ahead, okay, um, and anyway, i've just been a long time follower and you thought you touched on a topic this morning. um, with this transgender in the library. um, with you. weirdo, what it is is a pedophile invasion with organized increments as they sexualize more and more. the children now ride them, the men now show their naked genitals, the children. this is organized crime. the children now ride them, the men now show their naked genitals, the children. this is organized crime. yeah, you know, i've seen that video that you're showing when you're talking about it and it's just heartbreaking and just very upsetting and frustrating and, um, you know, but i mean, it looks like a meth head, crazy person on the side of the road spreading their legs to a kid. but it's the media directing it and the organization is directing it because they're training us to accept hell on earth. yes, i have, and you know, the other thing is i have a deep red dog with her. what i say about this is they have one of those transgender library times, the one of the local public church, uh, our libraries here, and i emailed the church and i asked them if they were going to make a present, you know, at this event for, you know, just to stand up against it. and the email i got back was basically: no, we don't get involved with these types of things, that we just pray for it. that's right. we just hide. we just hide. and this would be a scenario where it doesn't really matter who. but let's say, elizabeth warren is the is the uh candidate and she gets like an andrew yang as a vp. so they go through those months of you know town halls and debating trump. um getting vetted by the media, so forth. and then they, uh, they hold a town hall. it's like a big left media um event where warren and yang are on stage with maybe a rachel matta or, uh, anderson cooper or boat, and they got the transgender basketball star in the front row and were maybe 20, 30 days out from voting day and all of a sudden a maga, hat wearing patsy, rushes the stage and maybe, maybe shoots it up, maybe blows it up, but literally takes out warren and yang and your media star rachel matta, uh, maybe the transgender basketball star too. and now we have a national crisis, but the left has no interest in delaying or postponing the election because they'll say that would make trump a dictator. and so in that last few days before voting day they have a new emergency meeting of the dnc and hillary is nominated, or, or, i think, michelle, oh yes, even, because this way she that way. there's no vetting, there's no time for her to face the scrutiny, no one questioning after the great loss. i, i bet money. uh. globalist attorney norm paddice here's to deal with us. it's a famous criminal lawyer, first woman lawyer, bunch of the stuff, and he's down here in austin visiting with us. i wanted to get him into this about the massive attack on free speech and more. we're also gonna have will johnson joining us with the incredible footage he got last night here in austin where a big fat man wearing a red wig basically tried to disrupt a group of small children and their parents and the police had to arrest him. he just keeps screaming: i'm transgendered, you know. basically i'm god. submit to me, give me access to your children. bleh. it's up on news wars dot com. we've got a huge sale running right now, but it's about the end. it's the iodine challenge: both types of iodine with selenium for 60 off together. from the front lines of the information war, it's alex jones. thank you, jonathan. um, well, i have been directly involved in this battle professionally for over a year. one black transgender woman fatally shot today. where black transgender woman was fatally shot in princestore county. where the god of 21 black transgender women with fatally shot in cleveland. so People, hey, Hey, What am I doing?

Get that, Rob, do compilation ready from earlier today. I'm gonna play that for norm pass. right now. You go to turn norms. I've probably seen him all over the news for years With big cases. He does be like F Lee Bailey- You name it, and he was here. He flew in to talk about some other things were up to in our ongoing battles with the deep state to stay on air. But this morning I said what do you want to come on about? And I figured to be all these attacks on the first amendment, the rest of you as well. Let's talk about Cheshire home invasion killer Who's a transgender, and the mother got killed, the two little girls. so I guess Let's do a document cam shot of this young lady here. What a man with a beard. So this is the type of stuff going on. We've got new video out Out of control: drag queen flashes crotch the kids at library story in Minnesota, And we also have photos that stations have complained about and listen stations. I guess it's a drinking game. You pick an offensive word and you say it and then the next guy has to say it louder and it goes louder and louder. The person who backs down in the end has to take a drink. so they were talking about a certain portion of the male anatomy, The third leg, as it were. when that word ran out of- they ran out of time with that word- They switched to the n-word. so they're walking through a park and somebody started the film when they were hollering penis Because they thought it was funny. when they switched to the n-word, that person suddenly became enraged and upset and they were saying: You know, nigger, louder and louder and louder. that person then sent the video to her mother, who called the NAACP. He created a storm and had the kids arrested for ridiculing people. No one was ridiculed. We're going to finish up these five or six calls- Eric, John X, Dallas, Jack and Brian- Before we end this transmission. But here's a little bit of a large man with a reddish-blonde wig Charging around in front of men, women and children trying to stop their free speech, Getting arrested in Austin last night. here it is: Black trans life matter. black trans life matter.

So Will Johnson's here to tell us exactly where this was and what happened. I mean, this is happening everywhere we're now that's coming in the schools, Not just the libraries, where these men come.

I'm your host, Alex Jones. We have another incredibly important transmission lined up for you today. We have Roger Stone with Big Breaking News joining us in the second hour, Drew Hernandez joining us in the third hour and Paul Joseph Watson in the fourth hour. And boy do we have a full plate on the war front, on the economy front, on the total AI takeover, censorship front, on the transgender nation front, on black reparations in California that cost $800 billion government estimates. It is all the design takedown of our civilization. Thank you for joining us again on this live, Uncensored, teleprompter-free edition of the Alex Jones Show. I was the first, really 25 years ago or so to track where the transgender movement came from. and it was created by the transhumanist movement of Aldous Huxley, who really founded the United Nations and really ran it for the 30 years that he was alive, after setting it up in 1946 at Presidio Naval Base in San Francisco.

And they said that once we bring up the family and once we confuse the genders, we can then separate children basically at birth and raise them as functionaries of the state, similar to the book his brother wrote in 31, or published in 32,, Brave New World, Aldous Huxley. So Huxley again wrote- I talk about this all the time and thank God now even Tucker Carlson is talking about it. If you go read it, it's incredible. We're going to chemicalize you and brainwash you from birth. You'll never know what hit you. And Bertrand Russell and others wrote books saying the same thing. So that's what this is. That's why it has pure, total corporate backing. And the good news is the public's really starting to figure out that the minions of this are mainly just autistic children who were put into the system and told they were transgender and celebrated and other mentally damaged folks because they always had to have a way to celebrate those they'd already brain damaged and then shunt them off into a sterilization program. But transgenderism is just the leading edge of this. And if you go to any of these transgender events in Kentucky or in Texas or in New York, we have countless videos. They are men dressed like clowns saying that's what a woman is at the clown, normally wearing bathymet outfits, And we have long compilations We played many times- We should probably play some of those- I haven't played them in a while- Of these individuals showing up at city councils everywhere in bathymet outfits. That happened a lot yesterday across the country, saying we're here to groom your children. You'll never know what hit you. And Bertrand Russell and others wrote books saying the same thing.

That happened a lot yesterday across the country, saying we're here to groom your children. They belong to us. We're going to get them. But Rand Paul goes: okay, well, are we going to ban all the other big tech here, Because they're all just the same? So I get his point as well, But it's a distraction from S-6-8-6. Because that bill does nothing to TikTok. It just takes over the entire web in the name of protecting you from TikTok and everything else. So we have that news. We have a big stack of the transgender cult going completely crazy all over the country As local governments and state governments move to protect children from the cult, which is extremely pedophilic at its heart. a lot of big developments on that front we're going to be going through. Also, I didn't see it in the stack. I meant to tell the crew, But we're going to be playing this coming up at the bottom of the hour. Cruz dims, perfectly willing to turn a blind eye to child rape and murder at the border. Ann Coulter has written a really informative article that I will not read here on air but you should read it. It's Transgender Nation. It's at townhallcom And she lays out the fact that it is a leftist sacrament of almost 90% white people who go get pregnant or adopt children so they can then tell them that they're another sex and force them, as it's now coming out, to transition and force them to cut their genitals off And what it does to little boys, how, for up to five years, they have to wear a giant cone inside their bleeding, bloody body because they don't have a vagina, they don't have a cervix, they don't have a uterus And let's just face it, women are amazing but they go through a lot: having a vagina, having a cervix, having a uterus, having ovaries And anybody that's been around and has a wife or mothers or sisters or children, I mean. you know, what girls go through is tough And they're designed with a vagina, with a cervix, with a uterus, to do this. And I was sent a clip yesterday that I forgot to send the crew that I hadn't seen. Tim Pool was playing a clip of this famous transgender individual. it's had a TV show, I guess, for over a decade, as the little boy transitioned to a girl And it's his mother making him do it and then him crying and complaining. but everybody loves the mother. she's a hero. When they chop the penis off, it goes over the years. And I was sent a clip yesterday that I forgot to send the crew that I hadn't seen.

When they chop the penis off, it goes over the years. I hadn't seen this till yesterday. I popped by my parents house, talked to one of their friends, one of my childhood friends, and I've known the woman since I was a kid, three years old. She was there. she said: have you seen this? I popped by my parents house, talked to one of their friends, one of my childhood friends, and I've known the woman since I was a kid, three years old. She was there. she said: have you seen this? And I said no. and then it was the mother making him wear in his body for five years a giant bloody cone inside of his body into an imaginary uterus. So not only did they chop his testicles and his penis off, but then they jammed a huge bloody cone up in him. it's infected and pus is dripping out. the person is in hell. mommy, why? Because I'm gonna kick your ass, I'm gonna come destroy you. the person is in hell. mommy, why? Because I'm gonna kick your ass, I'm gonna come destroy you. you're a girl you've known you're always a girl. she made him say he was a girl. she cut off his penis. she cut off his genitals. the state did it, and now he wears a pussing bloody cone in him. I mean this is just so macabre, like it's a nightmare novel. I mean, imagine 30 years ago if Clive Barker wrote novels where children are made to cut their penises and breast off and testicles and then boys are made to wear basically something worse than a chastity belt from an evil times, strapped around their body with a giant bloody cone up in their raw flesh that just continues to fester and bleed and open up in a huge torture device. she made him say he was a girl. she cut off his penis. she cut off his genitals. the state did it, and now he wears a pussing bloody cone in him. I mean this is just so macabre, like it's a nightmare novel. I mean, imagine 30 years ago if Clive Barker wrote novels where children are made to cut their penises and breast off and testicles and then boys are made to wear basically something worse than a chastity belt from an evil times, strapped around their body with a giant bloody cone up in their raw flesh that just continues to fester and bleed and open up in a huge torture device. and they said it's all a giant satanic sacrament and a sick joke that they do this. and then all these mainly white liberal parents are just lining up to do it and it's just a giant satanic ritual in everybody's face. it's just so over the top, so hellish. we'll talk about it all when we come back. it's bad. we're going to be watching this as it unfolds. I'm not saying there isn't a shooting in Forsyth Tech in North Carolina. I'm saying we hope it's not true. okay, so in Coulter's got a big article out, all these studies and numbers and research and it's dead on. but it is a phenomenon of 91 plus percent of the households where they are saying that the children are transgender or white and most of them are single mother led and it's just a thing that's hyped up. that's cool that everybody's got to do kind of like. in 2000s, the thing for hollywood people to do was to go adopt a black baby from africa. they- basically almost all of them- did it. that's at least adopting a poor baby. Mr Secretary, would you like to respond to any of those questions? What the Senator said was revolting. I'm not going to address it. Your refusal to do your job is revolting. See the full exchange at Infowarscom. Now, how obscene is it to say we've got to give the state and psychologists and the schools access to children to convince them they're in other sex and then mutilate them sexually and then accept mass shooters because we weren't nice to the transgender people and didn't accept their agenda? and then we've got stuff like this right here from the Associated Press: Reparations for black Californians could top $800 billion. Oh, remember Biden said he'd give everybody free education and forgive all the student loans Soon as he got elected. Oh sorry, You don't get that now. They're not going to give black people reparations. The people on top know what they're doing And the only way to reach out to these folks is to show them you're miserable because you were put in a psychological dungeon where the trick is they make you get deeper in the cult, thinking you get better, but as you get deeper and only gets more destructive. Here's a few minutes of what he had to say about it. So I get the visceral gut reaction to a lot of what's gone on in the past couple of days. However, one thing that I don't get is why we are exactly empowering a lot of the psychosis and, if not, fueling it. Now let me explain what I mean. The reason why you have these trans activists basically calling for a day of vengeance and you have people essentially taking up arms now that fly under the LBGTQIA2 plus whatever that is- flag, is because you have this prevailing narrative by the media powers, the Machiavellian shitlords that be that says: hey, everybody wants to kill trans people, Everybody wants to kill LBGTQ people. Your rights are being taken away and these people are bombarded with this day in and day out, Not only from the outside sources like the media, but also from their influencers, who basically come online and say the same thing verbatim and cite misused statistics and basically put it out there into the environment. One of the issues is that now you have people on the right who are seizing upon this, who are basically going the route of: okay, we're going to say that these trans people are nuts and we need to do something about them. and while, yes, I think that gender dysphoria is a topic that we need to tackle and the mental health institutions need to become more than just glorified psychoactive drug slingers, it does not need to become one of these situations where we have hard legislation because Congress screws everything up that they touch. Furthermore, when you start doing that, you start getting the pearl clutches and people wringing their hands, wanting something to be done which results in actual action.

Let me break this down to you, though. Part of the reason why you see a lot of violence against, let's say, female to male or not even female to male, male to female- trans people- See how confusing that is and you expect us to get pronouns right, come on. But part of the reason why a lot of this violence happens is because you have these trans people engaged in sex work. a lot of them get into pornography. and no, I'm not talking about all trans people, but I'm talking about the trans people who believe that somebody's out to kill them. Do you really want to do that? Because what you do is you create a self-fulfilling prophecy in which they think somebody's out to kill them. You basically radicalize some people who believe that trans people think this and that they're going to try to kill them first, and now you have people actually out to try and kill trans people.

So what's stopping these people from meeting somebody, kidnapping and killing just because they're a scummy person that also likes to have you know, also likes to have steamy encounters with trans people?

It's not because you have, you know, Joe Blow out in Alabama who's like: come on, boys, let's go kill some of them- shrimp arils. It's not because you have them taking some streets and doing it. it's because the inherent situations that most of these people who, let's be honest, typically if somebody's suffering from gender dysphoria.

There's a couple more minutes left of this when I put the rebroadcast up, but we'll put everything he said in, but I want to get him on as a guest. The great Roger Stone, the political analyst that got President Trump to run, the guy that's got the inside scoop in baseball on what's really happening, joins us for the balance of the hour here on this Thursday edition of the Alex Jones Show. He's about to give you the 35,000 foot historical view on what's really happening. They're now saying that the grand jury, because of the pressure put on it, the political nature of it, the Soros control, is now taking a month-long hiatus. They're now saying it's completely normal but really wasn't going to be happening. But I don't think they'll give up on Trump and so Roger's got a lot on that. He wants to get into the culture, wars and the transgender out-recruiting children. Now the Democrats have forged into the tip of their spear more on Hunter Biden's laptop and so much more on the political climate, Not just here but in the world, with the great Roger Stone. Roger, great to have you here from thestonezonecom. Alex, great to be back with you. Of course, when I'm at Infowars I always feel like I'm back home. Burning hell, New World Order. If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. All right, Drew Hernandez is going to be taking over for the rest of the hour because I got to go to a bankruptcy hearing online here in about 30 minutes, but I'm going to introduce him. next segment. But Tucker Carlson: three days before, the trans devil cultists are still suppressing the manifesto, attacked and killed these children and other innocent people. Tucker said: the trans people are going to start killing us. You've got the young turds and you've got all of them out there saying attack, attack. People are killing trans. Statistically, conservatives are killing no trans people, Their lifestyle, what they've been inducted into as children. on average, they're the highest level of suicide, death, murder, killing. next segment.

Statistically, conservatives are killing no trans people, Their lifestyle, what they've been inducted into as children. on average, they're the highest level of suicide, death, murder, killing. And it's the left that's chewing up these mainly young men that have been told they're girls and given these destructive hormones. So here's just a four-minute compilation, very small amount, of the evidence. it's so much of them saying: your children belong to us. Trans ideology claims dominion over nature itself. We can change the identity we were born with, they will tell you with wild-eyed certainty. Christians can never agree with this statement because these are powers they believe God alone possesses. That unwillingness to agree, that failure to acknowledge a trans person's dominion over nature, incites and enrages some in the trans community. People who believe they're God can't stand to be reminded that they're not. So Christianity and transgender orthodoxy are wholly incompatible theologies. They can never be reconciled. They are on a collision course with each other. One side is likely to draw blood before the other side. That's what we concluded last week. Police have released body cam footage from the end of the massacre. We're showing you just a small part of it. You can see the rest online if you want. We're not going to show it because it's too awful and sad. But what was almost as sickening to see, in a far more subtle and insidious way, was the media coverage of yesterday's tragedy. Here's Terry Moran of ABC News, for example, suggesting that Christians were murdered in Tennessee because they infringed on the rights of transgendered people Watch. Audrey Hale identified herself as a transgender person. The state of Tennessee earlier this month passed, and the governor signed, a bill that banned transgender medical care for minors, as well as a law that prohibited adult entertainment, including male and female impersonators. after a series of drag show controversies in that state, The state of Tennessee bans the sexual mutilation of children. Children get shot to death in a school. We're showing you just a small part of it. You can see the rest online if you want. We're not going to show it because it's too awful and sad.

Children get shot to death in a school. It's cause and effect. That's what ABC News is telling you. These people want to murder you, They want to kill you And they're showing it out in the open because even guys- this even happened with the press secretary of Katie Hobbs. She resigned yesterday because she came out in support of all the radical trans terrorism, of these people coming out and saying we need to kill Christians, We need to kill these people, We need to do this. All this radical rhetoric that's not covered by free speech, can't sit there and say: you want to murder people, All right, That's a direct threat to humanity. You guys understand that- I know you do. But even at the level of the press secretary of the so-called governor of Arizona resigned yesterday because she was sympathizing with the trans terrorists and their rhetoric to run around and go on the offense and hurt people that disagree with them. He's posting memes with individuals with guns saying that: oh, this is a. yeah, I totally support this, This is the, this is, this is what trans people do, and they, you don't want to come after us. I'm paraphrasing, But the point is here, ladies and gentlemen: do not be desensitized. Don't ever be afraid, And I know if you watch info wars, you're not afraid. you're not afraid of getting canceled. If you're still watching info wars, after everything Alex Jones has ever been through, you're not afraid of being canceled. And the mainstream media and the New World Order that's backing it all causes this mass instability. They need mass instability in the masses, in the population, So it gives them an excuse. This is on the book Rules for Radicals, right? They need mass instability, so the people are begging them for a savior. The people are begging for Big Brother, begging for big government, begging for the ones with the guns and the firearms to step in and put a stop to the violence, unlike martial law, right, See, but this is how these people cause this mass instability. And, by the way, let me just make myself clear, Just by the way, for the record, trans people do not exist, okay, They're not real. And let me explain to you why Some conservatives like just cannot comprehend this. It's like so mind blowing, right? If trans people have obvious gender dysphoria, mental illness, mental instability, they don't live inside of reality, They live in la la land. I don't feel comfortable in my gender.

Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, It's Alex Jones Transmuting worldwide from the summitme studios in the United Kingdom. You are listening to Paul Joseph Watson. Well, three days after a transgender terrorist entered a Christian school in Nashville and killed three nine-year-old children as well as three adults, We now have, three days on from that absolute outrage, Transurrectionists- yesterday in Kentucky and today in Tennessee- staging their own January 6 style insurrection- invading the Capitol building in Tennessee, entering the chamber, getting into physical confrontations with police officers. Unlike the January 6 insurrectionists, they weren't invited and escorted into the building. There you see this maniacal mob tussling with cops, screaming things about trans rights. They're very upset about losing the ability to chemically castrate children in Tennessee. They're upset about drag queen shows being restricted on public property, with kids not being exposed to degenerate sexualized trash. in the United States of America, though CBS News: Hundreds protest at Tennessee Capitol for tighter gun controls after Nashville shooting. Listen to how they frame it, given those scenes of that trans rights mob that you just saw there. Hundreds of school children- Didn't see many school children in that video. Teens and parents gathered at the Tennessee Capitol on Thursday to protest for tighter gun controls Three days after a shooter opened fire at the Covenant School. Again they're framing it as: oh, it's just a sober, humble, respectful, calm protest by children and parents outside the Tennessee Capitol. Reality screaming maniacal mob of transgender activists demanding more rights: The right to chemically castrate children, give them hormone blockers, puberty blockers, hormone treatment Says that the Capitol protesters lined the hallways and chanted at the state's Republican dominated legislature. They filed in, Filed in, They burst their way in and start fighting with the police. Oh, they just orderly filed in, didn't they? They were very respectful BS To begin taking up bills. for the first time since the shooting, chants of save our children echoed noisily in the hallways Between the state, Senate and House chambers, with protesters setting up shop inside and outside the Capitol. I guess they were just setting up shop too, were they? Some silently filled the Senate chambers, gallery some, what? two of them? They're all screaming like banshees. Watch the video- It's all over Twitter right now, Including children who held signs reading I'm nine, a reference to the age of the three kids who died in Monday's attack. Again, the bodies are barely cold and they're invoking the three victims of the transgender terrorist to try to get more guns taken out of good people's hands. Why did the transgender terrorist, Miss Hale- almost misgendered Miss Hale- then? why did the transgender terrorist refuse to target the other schools that were in the manifesto, the maps that she had, The other buildings, the mall, the other targets that were on that list? Because, as the police have said, they had better security. They had more good people with guns, But these people want fewer good people with guns.

They're not really offended about the monster with a gun that took those nine-year-old's lives. They're more offended about puberty blockers being withdrawn, hormone treatments being withdrawn, drag queens not being able to show their crotches around children. They certainly aren't being chaperoned by the building. The mainstream media- CBS News- is reporting that they're staging, in some cases, a silent protest as they literally scream their heads off and get into violent tussles with the police. Meanwhile, Joe Biden, whose first reaction to the horrific shooting on Monday, was to doddle around on stage like the Alzheimer patient- he is not making fun of people with Alzheimer's- very serious disease- but should the president of the free world be in that position? his first response was to come down and mumble about how he liked chocolate chip ice cream and crack jokes about it. That was bad enough. Yesterday he joked again when asked by reporters about Senator Josh Hawley's comments about the transgender terrorist attack being a hate crime. He said: well, if Hawley says it's a hate crime, then it's probably not, even though he hasn't even seen the manifesto, because no one's seen it yet. And I'm going to get onto that Again. he's joking with reporters, and he's done it again, Telegraph headline. There you see the clip from yesterday where he's asked about it by the reporters laughing and joking about it. Biden says if we protect LGBTQ plus individuals, our societies are stronger. Maybe if we protect schools full of Christian children, then our societies might be more immune to this kind of horror. But no, he didn't talk about that. He talked to world heads of state at a virtual event titled Summit for Democracy About a fair and stronger society. quote: when we advance equality and racial justice and invest in young people, protect the LGBTQ individuals, Our societies are not only fair, but they're stronger and more successful. This, of course, is after two days of the mainstream media expressing more worry and concern over misgendering people in relation to the transgender community And, in fact, in the early stages, after the shooting, misgendering the shooter herself. You saw that with USA Today, You saw it with New York Times, You saw it with BBC News, where they tried to blame the police. So the police were confused about the gender. Not really. The police came out straightaway in Nashville and said It's a woman.

The police came out straightaway in Nashville and said It's a woman. Only later, when it came out that it was a transgender identified individual, were the media like: Oh, we don't really know, Because they didn't want to upset the alphabet people by misgendering somebody who's just massacred children. God forbid we should disrespect the memory of that cretin. Absolutely incredible. This is interesting, though, Out of the Daily Mail. Nashville shooter was having private counseling sessions with school's head pastor before massacre where she shot his nine year old daughter because he wasn't on site.

Nashville shooter was having private counseling sessions with school's head pastor before massacre where she shot his nine year old daughter because he wasn't on site. They're now speculating and the school's denying this, by the way, So it could be 50: 50. I don't know, but it's being reported This transgender terrorist was actually having counseling sessions with the Christian pastor of the school. Now, what does that suggest? that the pastor was trying to convince Audrey Hale out of following this transgender lifestyle in line with the wishes of her parents, who, of course, said that they refused to respect the pronouns of this monster. They thought that she sold all the weapons that were in fact being hidden in the home. Was this pastor involved in trying to detrans this trans identified individual And was that one of the motives for the attack? This is interesting, though, Out of the Daily Mail.

Was this pastor involved in trying to detrans this trans identified individual And was that one of the motives for the attack? Former pastor of the Covenant School has claimed that the trans shooter, Audrey Hale, was receiving counseling sessions with the father of one of her victims. It is speculated in this report and others that that footage you saw of the killer wandering around the school was where she was actually trying to find this pastor, who was the father of Haley Scruggs, tragically, of course, killed in the shooting. that the pastor was trying to convince Audrey Hale out of following this transgender lifestyle in line with the wishes of her parents, who, of course, said that they refused to respect the pronouns of this monster.

But the pastor Scruggs was not in the school building And so the transgender terrorist instead, having wanted to target him, simply shot his daughter dead. However, there's a huge grain of salt in this reporting, and it is that these claims have been denied by the Covenant School itself, with a spokesperson telling Daily Mail Metro. Nashville police have been clear: No one was targeted in the shooting and Pastor Scruggs was not counseling the shooter. So again we've seen this, with the media initially coming out and saying, oh, there's no known motive, because they thought the manifesto would remain hidden. They thought they could sweep the motive under the rug.

Of course we've seen Cenk Wieger and all these other vile people on Twitter suggesting that Audrey Hale was bullied and that we should stop bullying transgender people- Again, complete victim blaming behavior- absolutely despicable. Now there's a sense that this narrative is shifting to well, what involvement did this pastor have in the life of this transgender terrorist And maybe we can blame him? Maybe he was actually being targeted. But again that's contradicted by the fact that the police found maps showing other targets- malls, other schools that had nothing to do with Pastor Scruggs. So I would suggest that, as the school is denying, this report is actually not true.

So I would suggest that, as the school is denying, this report is actually not true. She wasn't directly targeting the pastor, She was targeting the school And that's going to come out in the manifesto. after the fact. Many of you will remember James T Hodgkinson back in I think it was 2017.. Again, deliberately targeted Republican shot up a baseball, a basketball practice game- I think it was one of the two, Of course- nearly killing Congressman Steve Scalise. It took days for the mainstream media to even acknowledge that he was a far left Bernie Sanders supporter and he believed the rhetoric that basically, leftists need to start killing Republican lawmakers in order to fight back against then President Donald Trump. Whenever there's a right wing or even a tenuously connected to conservatives mass shooting carried out by an individual with conservative politics, there's an immediate rush to release all the details, all the social media history, any manifesto that's available, so they can weaponize it and use it to tarnish their political adversaries. Strange, then, in this case, that we know there's a manifesto. the police came out immediately and said this individual's transgender identity is related to the motive of the shooting. there's a manifesto, and that manifesto almost certainly contains details of the motive and why this monster did it. Now you'll notice the difference. there wasn't an immediate call to release it. there was an immediate call to cover it up, to bury it, to hide it. there's a manifesto, and that manifesto almost certainly contains details of the motive and why this monster did it. Now you'll notice the difference. there wasn't an immediate call to release it. there was an immediate call to cover it up, to bury it, to hide it. Trans advocates decry calls to release Nashville School Shooters Manifesto, reports ValiantNewscom. They cite, of course, this Newsweek report that left wing LGBTQ groups are calling for more focus on gun control and less focus on the transgender shooter's mysterious motives. It should not be published, said Jordan Budd, executive director of children of lesbians and gays everywhere to the outlet. The focus should be on how basically they can exploit it for gun control. PFLAG- very shady name there, an organization for LGBTQ support within families- apparently cited the risk of contagion and told Newsweek the manifesto's contents don't change the outcome of the tragedy. Every time somebody who can be tenuously connected to conservative politics carries out an outrage, they immediately call for the manifesto to be released in full. it's just a matter of when. There are some incredibly brilliant psychological minds and psychological analysts combing through her entire life, and that is the FBI behavioral analysis unit. Some people have questioned- and you can't blame them- whether the FBI is actually going to release this manifesto in full. If they've got control of it, how much of it will be redacted? to protect the LGBTQ community, as Joe Biden in his comments earlier has said, is one of the biggest priorities. after this transgender terrorist shot three children dead, Presumably once we get the manifesto in the name of protecting the LGBT community, Of course the media reports and the immediate aftermath of the shooting focused in on Tennessee restricting drag queen performances in public venues and, of course, on banning what they call gender affirming care, which is basically chemical castration of children, puberty blockers, hormone treatment for children who, without even consent of their parents- and they're doing a similar thing in schools in the UK, which I'm going to get on to say they identify as non-binary, as transgender, after in their confused embryonic minds, having been re-educated, socially engineered, indoctrinated, brainwashed with that very canon in the public schools themselves. So the media came out and said this has got something to do with Tennessee doing this, using that in a way to justify the shooting itself, which is particularly sick, but at least acknowledging that that was likely one of the motives of the shooter? will it come out in the manifesto or will it be a different narrative, which I spoke about before the break, where they're trying to make it into the direct personal targeting of this pastor and a personal grievance? because if they run with that narrative, they can then circumvent having to ask serious questions about whether this very small fraction, this trans activist movement, is becoming radicalized, is becoming violent, is becoming more dangerous, especially given now, of course, as we've seen them taking up weapons, training them, staging trans day of vengeance on April the 1st, which will still go ahead, by the way. you'd think they'd maybe look at the optics and think a transgender terrorist has just killed three infant children. to protect the LGBTQ community, as Joe Biden in his comments earlier has said, is one of the biggest priorities. after this transgender terrorist shot three children dead, Presumably once we get the manifesto in the name of protecting the LGBT community, Of course the media reports and the immediate aftermath of the shooting focused in on Tennessee restricting drag queen performances in public venues and, of course, on banning what they call gender affirming care, which is basically chemical castration of children, puberty blockers, hormone treatment for children who, without even consent of their parents- and they're doing a similar thing in schools in the UK, which I'm going to get on to say they identify as non-binary, as transgender, after in their confused embryonic minds, having been re-educated, socially engineered, indoctrinated, brainwashed with that very canon in the public schools themselves.

children. should we cancel an event which is literally called the trans day of vengeance, which some supporters have posted images of themselves with firearms in support of that trans day of vengeance? is it wise, is it reasonable, is it cogent to maybe put that on ice for a week or two? no, it goes ahead anyway. these people, of course, have no common sense because in many cases they're mentally ill. back to the manifesto. you'd think they'd maybe look at the optics and think a transgender terrorist has just killed three infant children. should we cancel an event which is literally called the trans day of vengeance, which some supporters have posted images of themselves with firearms in support of that trans day of vengeance? is it wise, is it reasonable, is it cogent to maybe put that on ice for a week or two? no, it goes ahead anyway. these people, of course, have no common sense because in many cases they're mentally ill. back to the manifesto. revolver news reports, LGBTQ activists fighting tooth and nail to keep transgender shooters manifesto buried. they know that the FBI is going to comb through it and it's apparently going to be released. after that but say there's a catch, the FBI will pour over the document and likely redact much of it. secondly, the release date is still unknown, so they're speculating. maybe we won't see this for weeks, for months,

don't go away. enrich your life, empower your body and keep us on air. please take action now. info war storecom leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. it's alex jones, live from london, england. it's paul joseph watson with summit dot news. now, two days before the school shooting, there was another outrage involving this uh, much vaunted transgender community, and that took place in new zealand, where a women's rights activist who committed the crime of tweeting. a woman is an adult, human, female. that's it. that's all she did. she set up a speaking event at which women's rights activists who want female spaces protected from grown, hairy men displaying their genitals in public bathrooms and places like that. that's all she did. she set up a speaking event at which women's rights activists who want female spaces protected from grown, hairy men displaying their genitals in public bathrooms and places like that. that's all she wanted: a lineup of women speakers to reinforce female spaces, women's rights, basically, old-school feminists. posy parker- that's the name she goes by. no, that's not allowed. she has to be viciously, violently attacked by this huge mob who, by the way most a lot of them- weren't even transgender identified individuals. they were just huge, six foot two, grown men, not even pretending to be women. she was mobbed, she was attacked. she was also doused with uh soup, tomato soup by this transgender activist who has now literally fled the country and has entered america, presumably because he tweeted that he was on a plane going to america. this is a literal fugitive, now fundraising on an online platform to protect himself against legal ramifications for assaulting posy parker. posy parker- that's the name she

legal ramifications for assaulting posy parker. this headline is out of redux dot info, which is an excellent resource on this kind of insanity. new zealand trans activists charged with assault after attacking women's rights campaigner. trans activists who threw tomato juice on a women's rights campaigner during a free speech event in auckland has been charged with common assault and again, this took about two or three days for this individual to even be charged after a massive online backlash. the police allowed her to get attacked. she had a few security guards, thankfully, protecting her. she said at the time or immediately after, she thought she'd be dead if she fell down. she'd be trampled on. she'd be absolutely mobbed and attacked. eliana rubish akin, also known as eliana golberstein and eliana rubinstein, is a male who identifies as transgender and intersex- whatever that is, uses they them pronouns. march 25th, rubish kin attacked women's rights campaigner kelly j keene- that's posy parker's real name- during what was supposed to be a peaceful women's rights demonstration. again, as i explained, keene had arranged for a speaking tour of new zealand based around giving women a platform to express their thoughts on gender ideology. she was forced to cut the tour short and this was wasn't even the first incident. she went to australia. they cry out in, they lash out in pain, or they cry out in pain as they lash out and attack you. they do that every single time, like david pacman, the guy who tweeted: oh, i guess the the kids at the school who were slaughtered just didn't pray hard enough. he gets rightfully criticized for that. then he claims about anti-semitism. he claims he's getting threats. they do this outrageous behavior, in this case with this transgender activist, physically attack people and then claim that they're the victim- the cry bully syndrome every single time. videos of the incident have since circulated on social media. you've probably seen it by now. following the event, rubish akin gave an interview where he claimed that he targeted keen because her words are blood, because they're killing our people. tweeting a woman is an adult, human, female. bear in mind, not even kyle written house. people with, uh, lesser involvement in actual violence than kyle written house, despite that, of course, being completely justified given that he was under violent, deadly attack- use platforms, like you know, go fund me and different fundraising platforms for any political cause, basically not even particularly controversial causes, because they're conservative, because they write their right wing, they get banned immediately. this individual, who has been charged with assault and has fled the country as a fugitive, goes on give a little dot co, dot nz and he's raising money for security expenses and has so far raised over nine thousand dollars in just a few days, while this individual is literally a fugitive, charged with physical assault, pretending to be a victim and grifting off of the back of it, and this donation platform is facilitating an actual fugitive criminal in the raising of this money- absolutely incredible behavior. let's go quickly to this first video, though. otherwise i'm not going to get through any of them. this is about a power lifter who responded to the canadian power lifting union saying transgenders can identify as any gender by entering one of the competitions and trying to prove a point. this is called the proof is in the pudding. here it is. canadian power lifting union recently announced a progressively inclusive new rule. their trans inclusion policy said transgender power lifters would be able to choose which gender category they compete in- quote, whether or not they have undergone hormone therapy. otherwise i'm not going to get through any of them. this is about a power lifter who responded to the canadian power lifting union saying

announced a progressively inclusive new rule. their trans inclusion policy said transgender power lifters would be able to choose which gender category they compete in- quote, whether or not they have undergone hormone therapy. rv silverberg, a powerlifting coach, decided to put this to the test. silverberg, now, identifying as a woman, stepped up to take part in the heroes classic powerlifting, meet women's bench press. and here's what happened. competing in the 84 kilograms plus women's category, silverberg broke the record rv set out to prove that gender self-identification policies in sport were completely unfair. Yes, I just said that. That's who has charged the 45th president of the United States with an indictment that doesn't allege crimes. It says you covered up other crimes, but does it say what the other crimes are? Absolutely dumbfounding, flabbergasting, poleaxed. And then we've got more video. White House press secretary says it's not for us to decide if killing Christian children constitutes a hate crime, But she did say last week that the attack shows that there is a suppression of our trans people. And Biden said trans are the soul of the country. That more election meddling. ABC News blurs out Trump donation number. They don't do that for Democrats. it's being reported around the country that literally no one is buying Budweiser or Bud Light. You shouldn't buy any Anheuser-Busch products ever anyway. it's a globalist company, But they advertise: we're the common man, We're the average Joe, We're red, white and blue. Yeah, maybe 20 years ago, Budweiser is a globalist company and they hired the lunatic Dylan Mulvaney, and you know, to be the woman of the year and all the rest of it. She's a woman of the year about a bunch of publications and said: this is what a woman is. Well, now Nike has piled on and is mocking women at sponsoring transgender activists, promote sports bra. So this is all just the psy-op to destroy the country. And yes, why would Nike destroy themselves? Why would Anheuser-Busch destroy themselves? Because they're all weapons systems. MSDS is a document that details the hazardous components of a product, Its characteristics, effects on human health, as well as its handling precautions. And this is the data sheet for hydrofluorosolic acid or acid-based fluoride. Health hazard highest rating for deadly, Number three, extreme danger, hazardous, And it's listed at a four. It's an oxidizer, an acid, It's explosive And it goes on and on and on: May deteriorate, Shock and heat, Violent chemical change, Unstable. So that's what Rachel Levine, the admiral, says is good for you And something that you need to drink if you're the children. So it wants to cut your children's testicles and penises and breasts off Because it's a program of sterilization and death that they make fancy and cool and fun and are right And they're suppressing what the fluoride does to you and your family, as I showed you last segment. But you can see the ratings on it right there: The highest level danger ratings listed on it for toxicity and poison. Now let's continue. What is this? This is a weapon system. when this happened last Friday or last Saturday, I said: watch, All the other big corporations will now hire the same individual and make Dylan Mulvaney the spokesperson. So now Knight came out and said: man, let's join that And let's immediately, as fast as we can, hire him to do this so that Knight can get on board and everybody else can get on board. So you're just totally overwhelmed with this lunatic colonizing women's spaces, knowing full well- obviously a comedian- that he's getting massive money to play along with the system as a mercenary. They want it as revolting and ridiculous and as mindless as possible. Knight's accused of mocking women. we're going to play the clip in a moment with audio after sponsoring transgender activists to promote sports bra, And we're live right now. I didn't send the clips to the crew but in post. when this is posted to me in that video it's actually over here in the stack. I want to add the photos and videos, Not a Kid Rock blowing up the mud light, but of Austin and H-E-B and the giant piles of the Budweiser products that nobody's buying. We'll add that in post. you're right, we stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden, and we say no, and we say no to your war, leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. it's Alex Jones cartoon produced by the CIA last year for recruitment, for information, warfare against the American people. imagine the type of people they're trying to hire, schizophrenic criminals. alright, I want to respond to Flagman and then go back to him and give him a response to my response. we live in a complex civilization where we've decided to not use force to settle our differences. now, within that so-called civilization, they hide the aggression with the poison fluoride and the fentanyl, and the transgenderism and the genital mutilations and all of it. but you first have to identify the cult and the globalist and who they are, because it's not like Operation Valkyrie. the Germans tried to kill Hitler a few years before the war ended because they knew they were losing and that Germany would be destroyed and Hitler wouldn't give up. they failed. they could have killed Hitler and ended World War 2 and saved 10 million German lives. please take action now. if you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. alright, let's go to Drake, who has been holding patiently from the great state of Texas. Drake, thank you for calling hello. Alex, I've been listening for a few years now. I hear what you're saying about the transgender and how it's evil, but when you talk about Blair Wyatt it's kind of confusing, like do you think he looks good or something? no, I'm not being a hypocrite about that. I do not dislike gay people. I do not dislike adults that have decided to be transgender. I'm saying the system running it is going after children and is targeting them to confuse them and try to get them into that. Drake, thank you for calling hello. Alex, I've been listening for a few years now. I hear what you're saying about the transgender and how it's evil, but when you talk about Blair Wyatt it's kind of confusing, like do you think he looks good or something? no, I'm not being a hypocrite about that. I do not dislike gay people. I do not dislike adults that have decided to be transgender. I'm saying the system running it is going after children and is targeting them to confuse them and try to get them into that. I don't hate adults as long as they don't hurt anybody else and I've been consistent about that. I don't care if it's heterosexual or homosexual or transgender or whatever it is. stay away from children. no, I'm not being a hypocrite about that. I do not dislike gay people. I do not dislike adults that have decided to be transgender. I'm saying the system running it is going after children and is targeting them to confuse them and try to get them into that. I don't hate adults as long as they don't hurt anybody else and I've been consistent about that. I don't care if it's heterosexual or homosexual or transgender or whatever it is. stay away from children. I've been 100% consistent and Blair Wyatt has been the same and I think Blair is a very smart, nice person. that's what I said. and Blair Wyatt speaks out against the targeting of children. I don't care if it's heterosexual or homosexual or transgender or whatever it is. stay away from children. I've been 100% consistent and Blair Wyatt has been the same and I think Blair is a very smart, nice person. that's what I said. and Blair Wyatt speaks out against the targeting of children. Blair Wyatt came on like 10 years ago when Blair first went public as a transgender person and said she was against the left and that they didn't speak for her. so I'm not judging people. that's what Blair Wyatt has decided to do with that body and that is what adults can do, like women- get breast implants, whatever. I'm not judging Blair Wyatt. they are very consistent. Blair Wyatt came on like 10 years ago when Blair first went public as a transgender person and said she was against the left and that they didn't speak for her. so I'm not judging people. that's what Blair Wyatt has decided to do with that body and that is what adults can do, like women- get breast implants, whatever. I'm not judging Blair Wyatt. they are very consistent. they say: we hate transgender, we want to stop transgender, we want to hurt transgender. no, the transgender movement. there's always been men that thought they were women. there's always been stuff like that- a very small percentage. but now they are making it the national motto, they're pushing it on the kids and it is a weapon system to hurt our children. so I'm not judging people. that's what Blair Wyatt has decided to do with that body and that is what adults can do, like women- get breast implants, whatever. I'm not judging Blair Wyatt. they are very consistent. they say: we hate transgender, we want to stop transgender, we want to hurt transgender. no, the transgender movement. there's always been men that thought they were women. there's always been stuff like that- a very small percentage. but now they are making it the national motto, they're pushing it on the kids and it is a weapon system to hurt our children. right, but you still kind of play along with her and call him or her. so it's confusing because I'm like more like Blair Witch. well, I'll say this: look, when you have a giant fat dude, you know, in wrestling competing against women, or a dude that's two feet taller competing against women and swimming. again, Blair Wyatt is not going into women's sports. Blair Wyatt is not attacking women. Blair Wyatt is not doing any of that. and so I've said that when I've interviewed Blair Wyatt- and I think Blair Wyatt is a very nice person, okay, so that's where I'm at, that's where I've always been- and the left wants to say, oh Jones hates transgender people. and then you're like: hey, you're being a hypocrite. you say you hate transgender people but you like Blair Wyatt as a nice person. no, I never said I hated transgender people. oh yeah, not hate them. again, Blair Wyatt is not going into women's sports. Blair Wyatt is not attacking women. Blair Wyatt is not doing any of that. and so I've said that when I've interviewed Blair Wyatt- and I think Blair Wyatt is a very nice person, okay, so that's where I'm at, that's where I've always been- and the left wants to say, oh Jones hates transgender people. and then you're like: hey, you're being a hypocrite. you say you hate transgender people but you like Blair Wyatt as a nice person. no, I never said I hated transgender people. oh yeah, not hate them. but I'm saying we can stand against them and reach out to them, but not play along and keep poses on them. Blair Wyatt said to me after the podcast that you know, you've really taught me about the chemicals and what happened to me and it's really helped me understand what happened to me. Blair Wyatt is not attacking women. Blair Wyatt is not doing any of that. and so I've said that when I've interviewed Blair Wyatt- and I think Blair Wyatt is a very nice person, okay, so that's where I'm at, that's where I've always been- and the left wants to say, oh Jones hates transgender people. and then you're like: hey, you're being a hypocrite. you say you hate transgender people but you like Blair Wyatt as a nice person. no, I never said I hated transgender people. oh yeah, not hate them. but I'm saying we can stand against them and reach out to them, but not play along and keep poses on them. Blair Wyatt said to me after the podcast that you know, you've really taught me about the chemicals and what happened to me and it's really helped me understand what happened to me. so I mean, and I'm not sure exactly what happened to Blair Wyatt, but Blair Wyatt really feels like a woman and is not a bad person, and I'm not attacking her because she feels like she's a woman. Alright, we're taking phone calls right now. I'm going to go right back to your calls. some stations don't carry the first five minutes but a lot do. that's when they carry news and so a lot of you might have missed the call. it's very reasonable and I appreciate your call. and said you're really worried about transgenderism and our children, but you've gone on Blair White. it was a very nice transgender male to female person who first came on my show as a listener ten years ago to say that they did not believe in targeting children and gun control and the whole leftist ideology attached to Blair White's decision to be what Blair White is. I said I don't hate anybody, I don't want the targeting of children. I don't want the sexualization of children by Rachel Levine. I don't want them covering up fluoride in the water for the children. I'm going to go right back to your calls. some stations don't carry the first five minutes but a lot do. that's when they carry news and so a lot of you might have missed the call. it's very reasonable and I appreciate your call. and said you're really worried about transgenderism and our children, but you've gone on Blair White. it was a very nice transgender male to female person who first came on my show as a listener ten years ago to say that they did not believe in targeting children and gun control and the whole leftist ideology attached to Blair White's decision to be what Blair White is. I said I don't hate anybody, I don't want the targeting of children. I don't want the sexualization of children by Rachel Levine. I don't want them covering up fluoride in the water for the children. there's an evil agenda that is behind pushing this to children and Caitlyn Jenner and all the rest of it. they're doing far worse. the first step behind closed doors. they're hypocrites, and so that's where I'm at. I agree we are who we really are, born as we should accept what God did. the system is trying to confuse that confuse children. but the people that have been sucked in by this- that's why it's gone from one in a thousand being transgender fifty years ago to one in ten in San Francisco with the kids- is because they're confusing them. they ask: little boys, do you like little boys or little girls? I like little boys more. little boys want to play with little boys- oh, you're gay. or little girls: you like little girls, you're a lesbian. but at the same time I catch myself sometimes driving in the car just thinking about the most horrible thoughts about my enemies, the horrible things I want to do to them, and God says that's not Christ-like. defeat them, stop them and do that, but don't get on their level, don't give them the hate back. love is more powerful, there's a stronger force, and so that's what it comes down to. I mean I've gone on Blair White's show and explained how they put chemicals in the water to confuse kids and try to target them when they're little to break them up with their families and how that's wrong. and then Blair White agrees: I'm reaching out to that whole audience. and then you read all these transgender people in the comments going: oh, I see why they don't like Alex. he's actually nice. yeah, I do think they're doing this to us. blah, blah, blah. I don't feel that way either. no, no, no, no. there's no time for that, that type of mentality and behaviour, with all the cuckery going on and the political correctness and people bending the knee to the woke mob and the totalitarian New World Order regimes on both sides in the uni-party. do not be deceived. the two party system is absolutely against you and your family. you can identify very quickly who's truly: America first, pro-humanity, pro-Christ, pro-God, that believes in the traditional values that got humanity to this point here in the future, in 2023, which, by the way, when you take a look at the radical New World Order agenda, whether it's coming from the left, whether it's coming from the right, it is all anti-Christ, demonic, satanic in origin and it's always an attack on God himself and those that are made in the image of God, which is us humanity. and when you speak about the transgender movement, let me just make a pretty obvious point to the viewers right now is that trans people just don't exist. you know, this is my view, because you know if trans people have gender dysphoria and it's a mental illness, let me just put it out there. it's just a figment in their imagination. it's an alternate reality that these people find themselves living in and, at the end of the day, they're just homosexuals or lesbians, which is against God as well. but you take a look at these woke tards like Dylan Mulvaney. there's no time for that, that type of mentality and behaviour, with all the cuckery going on and the political correctness and people bending the knee to the woke mob and the totalitarian New World Order regimes on both sides in the uni-party. do not be deceived. the two party system is absolutely against you and your family. you can identify very quickly who's truly: America first, pro-humanity, pro-Christ, pro-God, that believes in the traditional values that got humanity to this point here in the future, in 2023, which, by the way, when you take a look at the radical New World Order agenda, whether it's coming from the left, whether it's coming from the right, it is all anti-Christ, demonic, satanic in origin and it's always an attack on God himself and those that are made in the image of God, which is us humanity. and when you speak about the transgender movement, let me just make a pretty obvious point to the viewers right now is that trans people just don't exist. you know, this is my view, because you know if trans people have gender dysphoria and it's a mental illness, let me just put it out there. it's just a figment in their imagination. it's an alternate reality that these people find themselves living in and, at the end of the day, they're just homosexuals or lesbians, which is against God as well. but you take a look at these woke tards like Dylan Mulvaney. alright, you got. it's quite the opposite. but what I'll say is this- and I don't know if the crew, I'm pretty sure they can: if you guys can pull up a picture of Baphomet, Baphomet with little children around him, right, the depiction of Lucifer, half beast, half man, half woman, always with little kids sitting around looking up to Baphomet. this has been a depiction of Satan for centuries. and you want to talk about the so-called trans movement? I'll just use the term for now. I don't believe trans people exist at all. and there it is right there, always with little kids sitting at the side, looking up, half beast, half man, half female, and you can argue, maybe part angel as well, with the wings on the back, because Lucifer is a fallen angel as well. what is this really? I know it's easy to make fun of Dylan Mulvaney because he's mentally ill, mentally unstable, but I think the darker and more serious issue is the state of the culture, with the total depravity right now going on, with the so-called LGBTQ movement waving that damn flag around, hijacked the rainbow, which belongs to God, by the way. it just seems like these people steal everything.

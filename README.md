## Isn't this just a hatespeech generator?

look ok when you say it like that it sounds like a much less funny idea ok. That's why I'm adding Infowars and stuff into the training data, and trying to find stuff from conspiracy theory pages -- to ensure it gets absolutely batshit rather than just parroting ideology. But at the end of the day it will be down to the user to prevent misuse

## Why all the rainbow line breaks?

cuz i'm gay

and like to reenforce that i'm not making this because I agree with terfs in any way
